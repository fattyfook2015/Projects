3,Why is it so uncommon for U.S. Presidents to choose not to run for a second term?,"It's really quite surprising to me that only 3 presidents (James K. Polk, James Buchanan, and Rutherford B Hayes) ever announced in advance that they would serve a single term. All of the other single term presidents either died in office of natural causes, were assassinated, ran and lost re-election, or wanted to run for re-election but were so unpopular within their own party that they were not re-nominated.",history

5,Question regarding Wang Lun (王伦) White Lotus Rebellion 1774 Shandong," Can anyone expand upon govt tactics involving ""the polluting power of dog shit and urinating prostitutes""? Did govt forces lob volleys of excrement? Have prostitutes piss from the parapets?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In 1774, two years after the arrest of several prominent north China sectarians (including the leader of the Shan county Lius), Wang began spreading rumors of the impending turn of the kalpa, and in the fallwith arrests threatened in response to these stories-he rose in rebellion. It was a small-scale and short-lived effort. Wang began with only a few hundred followers, and he managed to recruit only a few thousand more on his way through the lightly defended county seats of western Shandong to the Grand Canal city of Linqing. There the rebels occupied the Old City, and for a time used a variety of invulnerability rituals to good effect against the firearms of the besieged Qing garrison in the New City. Soon, however, the government soldiers countered with the polluting power of dog shit and urinating prostitutes, and the sect's rituals lost their efficacy. Less than a month later, the last hold-outs, resisting to the end, were burned or slaughtered in the city.

8,Were people more learned in the past before the advent of the internet?,"Because prior to the internet age, anything one learned was essentially entirely from books, newspapers, or word of mouth i.e. lectures, and sometimes television. I find that when I watched some programs or tv shows from the 60's and 70's, people back then were very knowledgeable and eloquent speakers. Was that really the case?

Why has this topic faded into obscurity in the decades since?","I am generally aware of what ""Quemoy and Matsu"" is, from looking it up online. It seems to be a talking point on curtailing the spread of communism at the time and on whether or not a group of islands near Taiwan were worth committing US resources towards defending. However, I can find no mention of it on this subreddit nor did I ever learn about the discussion ever occurring during my history classes. 

When I rewatch Nixon and Kennedy's televised debates, I notice ""Quemoy and Matsu"" coming up as a talking point and asked question each time, so I assume it must've been quite an important discussion at the time, yet nowadays it doesn't seem important enough to be taught in most schools.",history

13,Question about the title Earl,"So when looking at the different titles of nobility in the peerage earl comes from jarl. It’s the only title that’s shared with the Danes. How come after the conquest of 1066 the title stuck, whereas most other titles were replaced. 

Baron is an original English title


Viscount derives from count 


Earl as discussed above


Marquess was quite a late introduction in the peerage so not really relevant


Duke is seen all over Europe and comes from the Latin dux 

Earl just really stands out to me. Can anybody shed some light?",history

15,The first transgender surgeries (question inspired by The Danish Girl),I just watched The Danish Girl. I don’t know how historically accurate it is but in the 1920s a male artist went through two surgeries to become a woman. In the movie it was the doctor’s first attempt at these surgeries. I’m wondering about the history of transgender surgeries: did a lot of people die? When did the surgeries start to become more popular and safe?,history
16,Any suggestions for a book that picks up where 'Cleopatra' ends?,"Just finished reading 'Cleopatra' by Stacy Schiff and... Wow!! That was some real game-of-thrones stuff. Between the opulence and the family vendettas and the civil wars and the battles... Wow. Was it the last time in history that leaders declared themselves descended from gods? It was thrilling.

Anyway some time ago I also read a biography about Alexander the Great (I forget which).  That was some real Dungeons and Dragons stuff- swords, shields, actual magic! It left an impression on me all this time and 'Cleopatra' was like a sequel: I didn't know she was descended from Alexander the Great's General. 

So is there a book that picks up after Cleopatra dies? Something that shows what Octavian did with Egypt and the empire. King Herod appears in 'Cleopatra' and since it's so close to the year 0, is there a book that also brings in Jesus?

Thanks, everyone.",history

On one hand. Modern bows have far better materials and efficiencies that weren't available in the past millennia. On the other hand, modern archery is an entirely different beast from ancient archery. Bows today are entirely designed for hunting or target practice. Bows back then were made to hit through armored targets. Modern arrows could also differ from ancient arrows but I don't know their differences.",history
20,"Switzerland was considered near impregnable by modern armies in the 20th Century. Why then was it relatively simple for early modern and pre modern armies, like Napoleon and the Romans, to conquer it?","So pretty much like it says in the title. Switzerland was conquered by the Romans and Napoleon without significant difficulty, but would be very hard to conquer today afaik, and would have been difficult by modern armies in WWII. Why was this? Is it due the reliance of modern armies on motorised infantry rather than horses? What are the factors involved?

Edit: Thanks for the answers so far, but thus far answers have felt a little focussed on the impregnability of the country in C20. I was actually more interested in how Napoleon and the Romans successfully invaded a region famed for its natural defences. Apologies if this was down to my poor framing of the Q.

23,Which empire treated polish people the best?,"I was reading about anti polish sentiment in the German Empire. In the Ruhr area shortly after the Ruhr boom, Polish migrants had identification cards to identify them as polish as well as stereotyping polish people in postcards and jokes. I would have imagined it the same as Jim Crow stereotypes in segregated America. They also attempted to Germanize parts of Poland by forcing people to speak and learn German. They had German catholic priests give services in German to polish Catholics for example. 

How was the treatment of poles different in the Russian and Austrian Empire? Was it better or worse and who granted them the greatest autonomy?",history

29,Why is the replenishment of the eastern US forests not recognized?,"By the beginning of the 20th century, almost the entire eastern US forest cover was clear cut either for logging, agriculture, or coal. The pennsylvanisa desert is a good example, where the expansive forests of the central state were clear cut https://www.google.com/amp/s/spottedtoad.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/the-pennsylvania-desert/amp/

This was reversed by a massive effort in the 1930s as part of a land buy back program by the federal and state governments, where tens of thousands of men spent years replanting these woods during the great depression, this resulted in the replenishment of almost the entire eastern US forests.

 Thanks to that effort, Today, there is so much forest cover in these areas that the amount of cover is on the same level as it was in the 1840s. Why is this not celebrated as one of the greatest environmental conservation efforts in history?",history

Where do I live?

Can I travel out of France?

How am I treated by the Big Whites and Little Whites?

Who can I marry?

I think all these questions would be relevant because of both the Code Noir and the fact that free people of Haiti were a unique class in the Caribbean and certainly had more rights than most non whites during the age of sail. It's very interesting to hear about these perspectives as they represent people outside of the institutions which rule over them and yet are a part of it.",history

40,When did Anglo-Saxon Names Die Out?,"As all of us history nerds know, the Normans under William the Conqueror took over England in 1066 and proceeded to French/Norman-ify much of Anglo-Saxon culture over the next couple of centuries eventually resulting in today's English (to put it simply).

William replaced most of the Anglo-Saxon nobility with his own men immediately after the conquest so I assume Anglo-Saxon names were dead to the upper class then, but what about your ordinary English peasant? When did regular Englishman start having names like ""William and Henry"" instead of ""Edgar"" and ""Cuthbert""?

47,Pre-prohibition alcohol consumption and social context for start of temperance movement,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm watching the Ken Burns documentary and a while back read Last Call and I don't quite understand a couple of things about the start of the temperance movement. 

\- Was there or wasn't there a meaningful uptick in drinking prior to Prohibition? It seems there was always hard boozing in American life, as well as saloons.

\- Was there another factor that brought about the temperance movement? Was it a function of urbanization? A rise in religious life? What were the social forces that caused woman to start protesting? Surely men had been drinking just at Saloons as much prior to the temperance movement?

\- In the Ken Burns documentary one of the historians early in the first episode mentions that a lot of Americans switched from beer to liquor. I can't find any verification of this in any of the online articles on booze history. Was this true? Why? Did liquor become more available or cheaper? It seems that beer was also more available.

48,When did German intellectuals and policy makers start viewing Eastern Europe as a territory ripe for annexation?,"It seems many of the aims and goals of the Germans in WWII revolved around subduing the Soviet Union in order to secure land and resources.

When did this start to become a sentiment? When did this concept of subduing Russia and occupying her for exploitation become a true national sentiment or goal? Was this uniquely a Nazi ideological goal - or was this a more deeply rooted idea in German history?",history

This means that Christianity only took around 34 to 31 years to become so relatively well known and prominent in the Urbe to be blamed for such an event. How was it possible for a religion born from the teachings of the fanatical son of a carpenter (no disrespect intended to any christians reading this) to spread so fast that it was already a well known sect or religious minority towards the end of Nero's rule?

He goes on to say that they were then ordered to tear them down. He makes a brief mention on what the mood in Moscow would have been if the Germans had made a bridge head on the eastern side of the Volga, and that’s the end of it.

I know some of this is hindsight, and obviously the US wouldn't want to lose such a high ranking officer to the Japanese at the beginning of the war, but it just seems like he didn't do anything that could remotely be considered brave or selfless and really the opposite could be said.  I've heard some of the logic behind his medal was that in the midst of the tragedy and utter surprise and damage of Pearl Harbor the US needed some ""hereos"" to point to to show that we could beat this, but it just seems like the Medal of Honor was way too high of an honor to give to someone that didn't really do anything himself.

So I guess my question is how did the army and the general public react to him getting such a high honor?  Also, was this just a matter of the general public didn't know how bad things had gone in the Philippines, so there wasn't any thought given to this?  Did other generals or people in the military disagree with his Medal of Honor?

Alexander the Great and Caesar personally led their armies into battle. But even more recently, Washington and Napoleon took to the field to lead their troops.

So what changed in the past ~250 years to make this no longer the case? Are high ranking military officials more valuable now than before? Have modern weapons made it too easy to kill them and thus leave the army without a commander? Something else?

Edit: After two comments, I see that during WWII some generals/admirals were still going into the field.

This was roughly a century after Lothian is supposed to have changed hands. 

What's going on with that? Seems curious that a whole 100 years after the county is to have switched, it's still being described as England?

Also, was there any record as to the reactions of the people to being handed over to Scottish rule? I imagine the rural communities probably wouldn't be too fussed, but what about the people of Edinburgh?

130,"Much of the accepted narrative about Rosa Parks’ life and arrest is wrong. Yes, even that Drunk History episode.","After working on the new Library of Congress exhibit about her life - I was shocked at how many people were misinformed — including myself. 


Yes, there were others, like teenager Claudette Colvin, who protested on the bus before Parks and didn’t receive the same kind of notoriety. Not sure that this is a story about “who did it first” anyway, but what people don’t realize is that Parks had been a lifelong civil rights activist. 

Not just an activist for a day. 

She started officially working for the NAACP in 1943 (the bus protest occurred on December 1, 1955). At that time, the NAACP was considered a suspect group by law enforcement, so just being associated with them was a risk. She traveled across the South, gathering accounts from women who said they had been raped by police. She ran a student-activism group in Montgomery. She was the secretary for E.D. Nixon, then President of the NAACP Montgomery chapter.

Her grandparents were slaves. Her grandfather was the product of a white plantation owner and a slave. Though light-skinned, their family wasn’t spared from the terror of the KKK. As a child, she would stay up all night with her grandfather, guarding their home from KKK raids with a shotgun.

Due in part to history books and that Drunk History episode, many folks think her bus protest was planned, that she was sitting in the white section, and that she was “picked” to protest because of her nice old lady demeanor. None of this is true.

Parks was not sitting in the white section, but behind it. When the white section filled and a white male passenger entered the bus, the driver demanded that she move even further back. That’s when she refused to move. Most people don’t realize, Black folks were also asked to pay at the front of the bus, then get back off and enter through the back. At times, drivers would just leave before they could get back on. Parks had a bad experience with this same bus driver many years earlier and usually avoided his busses.

Her protest wasn’t planned. This is supported by myriad historical documents and even Parks’ own written accounts in her private diaries — just released to the public by the Library of Congress. She was 42 years old when she was arrested, not a weak elderly woman. And she wasn’t “chosen” by movement leaders to do anything — the movement itself was just getting started. MLK was virtually unknown outside of the Montgomery Baptist community. There had been a series of events in the summer and fall preceding the Montgomery Bus Boycott that began to foment action in the Black community in Alabama, namely Emmett Till’s Murder and subsequent acquittal of his admitted murderers by an all-white jury.

There is definitely some truth to the idea that Colvin was passed over as a poster child, namely, because she was a child. Rosa Parks did know of her arrest, so in a way Colvin could have contributed to Rosa reaching her breaking point.

The NAACP decided to publicly pursue Rosa’s legal case after her arrest because there was momentum. And because she was a TRAINED activist who could handle the scrutiny. This is not to say that the civil rights leadership embraced her strategic mind necessarily, as it was for the most part a sexist organization. Women were routinely not allowed to make speeches at large events. The summer before the bus boycott Parks took nonviolent protest training classes at the Highlander folk school in Tennessee. After her arrest she received death threats, lost her job, was forced to leave Montgomery, and she lived in poverty in Detroit for many years — not exactly the kind of thing you want to put on a teenager like Colvin. 

Ironically, Colvin’s 5-plaintiff legal case was actually the one that ended segregation on Alabama busses, not Rosa’s. Colvin’s case went all the way to the Supreme Court and won.

Park’s activism continued literally until her death. She spoke at the Selma to Montgomery March (ABC news archives has video of her speech and it’s amazing) and the 1963 March on Washington. She participated in several anti-Vietnam protests and through the 1970s and 1980s worked in U.S. Representative John Conyer’s office in Detroit. She created a scholarship foundation that took middle and high school students on civil rights tours across the South, educating them about the heroic work of other activists.

Her story is one everyone thinks they know and most of what they know is wrong. 

I am in no way the authority on her life or the civil rights movement and I do not work for the LoC, but I spent months working with some of the most incredible researchers and historians at the Library of Congress and learned an immense amount from them. 

EDIT: Some sources, including the current Library of Congress exhibit. I can provide direct links to individual primary source documents in the Library’s Rosa Parks collection (the public stuff) if that is of interest to people...I encourage folks to explore the collection’s manuscripts!

164,How did tiny Greece defeat mighty Persia?,"The Persian Empire at the time of its wars with Greece is estimated to have had a population of 50 million people.  Greece had around 500,000.  Persia therefore outnumbered Greece 100:1.  Yet it was Greece consistently defeating its much larger rival, and ultimately destroying it at the hands of Alexander (okay Macedonian, but Greek-influenced).  Usually this is simply explained away as ""the Greek armies were far superior"" - but *why?*  Persia had a long and glorious military tradition and had far more resources for vital elements such as archery and cavalry, even some exotic additions such as camels and elephants.  

So here is a theory.  The Greeks were divided into city-states that were almost constantly at war.  Under regular circumstances such internecine strife would be profoundly debilitating.  Probably because of that threat, the Greeks developed an honourable code of war that permitted them to fight each other without mutual destruction.  Heavily armoured infantry clashed and the goal was to drive the opposing army from the field rather than massacring it.  Afterwards there would acknowledgement of victory with exchange of the dead and a treaty.  The battle was hard but won or lost with relatively few casualties.  This meant that the Greeks were essentially performing non-deadly war exercises for decades, even centuries.  

But in Persia, internecine warfare was often between rival claimants for the throne.  With the need to eliminate all opposition not just to restore peace but to make an example for anyone else thinking of revolt later, wars were far deadlier and therefore both rarer and more debilitating.  

What Philip II and then his son Alexander achieved was capturing the best of both worlds: the traditional Greek skill of defence, but adding greater offence with deadlier phalanx and cavalry.  Now the army was not only extremely hardy but an instrument of extermination.  

So Alexander's conquests came from centuries of non-lethal rivalry among the Greeks suddenly  turned outwards.  The same can be said of the Mongol and Arab conquests, which also took on and defeated far greater powers.",history

* [Vlad the Impaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler) scaring off an Ottoman army by creating a ""forest of the impaled"", consisting of men, women, and children of disloyal demographics.

In war, it would seem to be a good idea, militarily speaking (but obviously not morally), to:

* Make an enemy army disabled by blinding them (this turns them into burdens on the enemy economy, and makes it harder for your enemy to find troops to wage the next war)

* Wipe out your enemy's peasants and city folk (to deprive your enemy of food, manpower and weapons)

* Impale an entire disloyal demographic (to make an example of what happens to those who rebel, and also to scare off invaders)

So why didn't these happen more often? 

* Even countries with avowed rivalries such as England vs. France or Ottomans vs. Persia didn't cripple each other by blinding defeated enemy armies. 

* Even Genghis Khan's annihilation of the Khwarazmian Empire was provoked by not 1, but 2 grave diplomatic insults. 

* Impalement didn't seem to be too common in history compared to other execution methods, and implements of entire disloyal demographics only seemed to happen in Wallachia.

Does this mean that there were rules of war (or at least customary rules of war) before the modern era?

Finally, since I am a fan of *[Europa Universalis IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Universalis_IV)*, there is this event called [Impalement of the Sultan](https://np.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/9khvov/impalement_of_the_sultan/), where the Ottoman Sultan and his heir are impaled by a Romanian army that conquers the Ottoman capital. Captured leaders were sometimes treated decently, so was there any reason to believe that a Romanian army would have impaled the Ottoman Sultan and his heir? Were there also rules of war dictating how to treat vanquished leaders?",history
178,Can someone explain how Trench Warfare worked in WW1?,"I just got back from seeing 1917, and I am quite interested in WW1 now. What I want to know is how trench warfare worked. I get the general idea of it, but I am confused as to how the trenches were made. How did people have time to dig these trenches before being shot? Where trenches one contiguous line across the entire front? If not, why did armies not just go through the spaces in between trenches? When a trench was captured, what happened? I know that multiple lines were connected with smaller lines, so did they have to capture the entire network? When an army retreated, did they make new trenches farther back? Why were trenches not as common in fronts other than the Western Front? Thanks in advance!",history
179,In what calendar are BC years written in?,"I think this question is pretty straightforward. The Julian calendar was replaced by the Gregorian calendar in 1582, with some countries taking longer to adopt the Gregorian calendar. As a general rule we write the Gregorian date after 1582, or write both the Old Style and New Style dates when someone might be referencing them. To my knowledge, we write all dates from 325 AD to 1582 AD in the Julian calendar, because the Gregorian calendar adjusts day error as though leap years have been done ""correctly"" since 325 AD this doesn't cause substantial problems with far away dates, I believe however that we always treat New Years as being on Jan 1st rather than March 25th. 

What calendar do we standardly use to describe dates before 325 AD, and before 1 AD? I'm guessing we just use the Julian from 1 AD to 325 AD since that would be most convenient for primary sources, but what about BC dates? Do we use converted ab urbe condita dates keeping with the Julian calendar, or do we go to the Gregorian Calendar and jump a few days at some point around Dec 31st 1 BC?",history

Or did appointed leaders rule the city as an extension of Athens and not just a member of the Delian League?

197,Are historians still divided over “the meaning of” Andrew Jackson’s political war against the Bank of the United States “and especially about the wisdom of obliterating” it?,"The late Robert V. Remini, who is still considered the prominent Jackson historian, states in *Andrew Jackson &amp; The Bank War: The Study in the Growth of Presidential Power* (1967), that:

&gt;""Historians still argue about the meaning of the struggle and especially about the wisdom of obliterating \[the Second Bank of the United States\]. To some the Bank War was an act of spite by an ignorant frontiersman whose stubbornness gravely injured his country. To others the War marked the necessary termination of a privileged monopoly whose powers were so extensive that it could disrupt business and intimidate the government.""

Has anything changed in the half-century since Remini wrote this? Do historians still argue or has it been resolved for the most part? Has it been discussed much at all? The stacks of books and gigabytes of PDF files I have on the subject haven’t been able to help me discern any sufficient answers so I hope to find help here. 

Thanks for your time. If interested, here is another excerpt from Remini’s book for additional context:

&gt;""THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES died ignominiously, and needlessly. It got caught in a death struggle between two willful, proud, stubborn men. Jackson and Biddle (Nicholas Biddle, the bank's president) were both responsible for permitting what could have been prevented. Both were reckless, both insufferably arrogant and vindictive. Between them they crushed a useful institution that had provided the country with sound currency and ample credit. At any number of points during the long controversy they could have compromised their differences and allowed the Bank to continue to serve the nation. Instead they preferred to sacrifice it to their need for total victory.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the hindsight that history provides, there is no question that the Second Bank of the United States needed curbing. It concentrated too much power in private hands, power that was repeatedly misused. In the hands of someone as capable as Nicholas Biddle, who could run financial rings around any and all of the Secretaries of the Treasury he faced, that power had to be carefully circumscribed. Granted Jackson provoked the Bank; the fact remains that it could inflict economic havoc at will, subvert the intentions of the administration, and defy the orders of the government. Thus it had to be reformed. But if curbing was impossible, as events subsequently proved, then, regrettably, it merited killing.   
&gt;  
&gt;In abolishing one efficient central banking system, Jackson can be faulted for not substituting another: one better controlled but one able to provide the country with adequate currency and credit. Some historians feel that his failure here condemned the nation to a century of unsound finance, and also, that after the Civil War, it encouraged robber barons to take advantage of their freedom and systematically pillage the Country. However, in view of the failure of a later central bank, the Federal Reserve System, to control economic opportunists in the 1920's, this criticism seems overly severe.   
&gt;  
&gt;But more important than the economic effects of the Bank War was its significance in party development, and particularly in the growth of presidential power. It is clear that in terms of party history the Bank War was the single most important event during the entire middle period of American history. Not only did it give rise to the Whig party, but the clash between the opposing Bank forces established rigid lines between the contending parties that lasted practically to the Civil War. It exalted such things as party loyalty; it demonstrated that the President could be a politician of the masses; and it fashioned the character of the Democratic party in terms of leadership, organizational discipline, and popular following for nearly a generation.""",history

200,Christian pilgrims the result of the inverse of Roman wealth.,"first let me state that i greatly enjoy abstract out of the box interpretations of history, even if 9/10 times off the rail ideas end with nothing. but sometimes this change of perspective can lead to whole new chapters of human experience.

that being said, if you notice during the renaissance we see expensive extravagant religious art and relics being displayed, and although the church could not directly profit, often the towns and cities that hosted these items did benefit greatly. that's proven.

but where did these pilgrims from northern europe suddenly find the money and time to invest in these mass pilgrimages. its east to say it was due to the burgeoning spice trade of the Dutch and English, but we are talking 1100-1300 a.d., a little early for Dutch globalization.

it could be the inquisition, a mass transfer of wealth seized from the accused and recirculated among christians. along with christian priviledge.

but i think it may be a result of the dissolution of the Roman/Italian Empire wealth as it finally collapsed from 800-1000a.d.

I was looking up some stuff in regards to the Danish monarchy when I came across an [article(?)](https://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/monarchy) on the official website for Denmark. The article claims that Denmark has the world's oldest monarchy and specifically claims that ""the Danish monarchy is the oldest continuing line in the world. Queen Margrethe II's heritage can be traced back more than a thousand years to a king believed to be born around year 900.""

As far as the Japanese monarchy goes, the Emperor claims a divine heritage that, supposedly, stretches back to, if I recall correctly, the 2nd century BCE. Now I can't speak authoritatively, but I highly doubt that all of Japan's emperors are actually descended from one family. 

Anyway, I decided to look up whether or not the Danish monarchy could make a similar claim. From what I've seen, though, that is not the case. Since the 8th century, Danish monarchs have come from a number of different houses.

227,Was Edward the Elder deposed/killed by his son Æthelstan in a coup?,"Æthelstan, the first king of England came to power following the death of his father Edward in 924.  Edward died while traveling to quell a rebellion in region of his kingdom which was formerly the kingdom of Mercia before its incorporation into Wessex.  His death seems to come out of nowhere in the record and very shortly thereafter his preferred successor and second son Ælfweard died without much explanation.  Then the Mercians unilaterally appointed Æthelstan, who was raised in Mercia as king. He would later go on to create the Kingdom of England.

I've learned of this from listening to the British History Podcast. There, it is only hinted at that it might have been a coup but it's merely a suggestion.

I'm hoping to find some historian's perspective on this matter and get a sense for what the consensus is (if there is any) on this question.",history
228,What are some of the biggest and most interesting fake news throughout history that made a big impact at the time?,"It seen strange from a finished high-school point of view, that this is not something that is focused on at all. I think it's important that we get to understand what fake news was like  at the time of it happening, and how it affected politics and such. I think it gives a bigger understanding of how news were manipulated and used for an advantage at the time.

German and USSR propaganda is ofcourse a prime example of ""fake news"", but other than that, what are some of the most interesting fake news throughout history? For example from the western world, that has been forgotten or slowly hidden away, and mabye is irrelevant today, but had a big impact at the time?",history
229,Was Mexico's control of Texas and California colonialism?,Texas and California were seized by the United States during the Mexican-American War in America's own form of expansionism and colonialism. However before American control of that territory you had the history of Spanish colonialism in the region with the Franscisan missions being the center of that. Then during the Latin American Wars of independence the region fell under Mexican control. Mexico at this time had a series of empires(First and Second Mexican Empires) and as part of their project they sent settlers and groups of people known as the Ranchos. Would this constitute a form of Mexican colonialism?,history
230,Have any wars/battles in history been fought completely by accident?,"I'm looking into the causes of the Battle of the Camel during the Caliphate of Ali. The way it seems to be spun in classical Sunni history books is that the battle started with both sides in their own encampments (each independently gathering to avenge the death of the previous Caliph, Uthman), and a Jew came and provoked both sides to fight in the middle of the night. I was wondering if there are other instances of this happening in history, or if this was the first time a battle was fought by complete mistake.",history

236,Why did citizenship and/or residence in a given state become a requirement for military service?,"Tried asking this on AskHistorians a while back, got no proper response. There are numerous historical examples of military officers that served in multiple countries' armies without being a citizen of the country in question. Examples include [James Keith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Francis_Edward_Keith), a Jacobite who served in the Spanish, Russian and Prussian armies, [Cort Sivertsen Adeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cort_Adeler), a Norwegian naval officer who served in the Dutch, Venetian and Dano-Norwegian navies and [Carl von Clausewitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz) served in the Russian army for a while.

These days officers do not typically switch between armies or navies in this fashion: I believe that in most cases, citizenship is a requirement for holding an officer's commission. Exceptions are rare and mostly apply to citizens of closely allied states. So the question is: when did militaries start barring non-citizens as officers and why?",history
237,Have there ever been instances when armies simply made peace with each other during wartime and refused to fight?,"ex. the 1914 Christmas truce, but on a larger/more prolonged scale. I’m curious to know about battles that were possibly fought using nonviolent means, or when both sides simply refused to fight.

I vaguely remember clips from a WWII documentary I watched at school and there were anecdotes of how the soldiers were shocked to see how the prisoners of war weren’t vile beasts, but humans. Didn’t higher-ups recognize the humanity of the opposing side and feel sympathy? Did soldiers ever resent having to fight to the death and consequently instigate mass-scale defects?",history
238,"Allied bombardments during WW2 - did they ever use bombs masked as ""toys"" or ""presents"" to inflict civilian casualties?","Hello folks, I'm from Bulgaria and there's this overwhelming local opinion that during the WW2 allied bombardments over our capital Sofia (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Sofia_in_World_War_II), the Allies dropped bombs disguised as toys such as pens as well as stuff that looked like gifts so civilians would pick them up and get injured. Since this sounds like very much fake news to demonize the enemy to me and I can't find any non-Bulgarian source that mentions any such bombs as being used at all (the Bulgarian sources being mostly from the local press, which I take with a grain of salt due to it being wartime and the need for propaganda), I want to ask - do we have any international sources that point out anything like that being used at all, anywhere? 

And if there -are- such sources, how would that even work? Delayed fuse or something similar?

244,Question concerning the cause of the Great War (and indirectly it's sequel),"Question inspired by the popular ""most powerful/impactful individual decisions"" discussion posted yesterday.

Two prominent answers there concerned the murder of Franz Ferdinand and the refusal of Hitler from an art school. My question is fairly simple: where either of these events really that monumental in regard to the world wars that followed?

Some additional context: when I was in high school, I made a 10 page essay on the leading causes of WW1, and the only time I remember mentioning the murder of F. Ferdinand is in the introduction as the ""finger that pushed the dominoes"". (This was 6 or 7 years ago, last year high school kind of quality essay, I have lost my original copy, so going purely from memory here, and my research was probably sub-par, even if I did put effort in.)  
Either way, my conclusion was that a continental war in Europe was all but avoidable at that point, since the confusing mess of interlocking alliances and centuries-old bickering had made for a jenga tower balanced in the middle of the street with a tornado on one side, a wildfire on the other, and rush hour passing through. The murder was just one of many potential events that threw blocks everwhere. Due to the distribution of power at the time (consider things like colonial possessions), it was unavoidable that any war on the European continent would quickly escalate to one on the world theatre.

Out of interest at the time, I also looked into the causes of WW2, albeit not nearly as deep, and quickly came to the conclusion that, without Hitler, eventually Germany would have rebelled against the treaty of Versailles, and again, at least a continental war would've been unavoidable, which would've spread at least to the Africa, which would involve the Ottomans, etc.. (it should be noted I am unsure how the Asian situation would've developed, if WW2 was 10 or even 20 years later, as a result of no hitler).

These are merely my insights on the situation, based on my high school research skills, and I'm just curious as to whether I'm wrong or limited in seeing it this way, but I would put either decision as marginally influencing, at best.",history

Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

246,What do you think REALLY happened when King Naresuan and Mingy Swa engaged one another on top of war elephants conducted during a royal elephant duel known as the Songkram Yutahatti?,"Before we start, I just want to say that I find Thai history and the history of Southeast Asia in general to be extremely fascinating and interesting. I think that it’s just as interesting as Chinese history or European history and I believe that Southeast Asian history is criminally underrated. 

Anyway, with that said, during the Burmese-Siamese War of 1584-1593, the official story (**according to the Thais**) state that King Naresuan‘s elephant along with Ekathotsarot and his elephant went into musth and broke ranks, stampeding into the army of Hongsawadee/the Burmese. King Naresuan took advantage of the situation and spotted Mingy Swa (Crowned Prince of Burma) on top of his own war elephant under the shade of a tree. King Naresuan called out something along the lines of “come out and duel me, no kings will ever do what we will do” and after that, a goddamn badass elephant duel commences between both royals. The duel between them was apparently so badass that both Burmese and Ayutthayan/Siamese troops stopped fighting each other and just watched. Eventually, after Mingy Swa got a lucky shot and cut off a piece of the brim of King Naresuan’s cover/hat, King Naresuan countered and managed to cut down the Burmese prince from his shoulder down to his hip. After Mingy Swa was killed, the Hongsawadee/Burmese troops retreated.

But that’s the **Thai** version of what went down. According to Burmese military records, Mingy Swa was shot and killed via **musket fire** and that Mingy Swa and King Naresuan never took part in any formalized duels. And according to this one source that I read, there are over **10** different accounts of what really went down during the Songkram Yutahatti, all of which are either Thai/Siamese, Burmese, or foreign accounts. 

I know that it’s incredibly fantastical and I obviously doubt that it actually happened since it just sounds so mythical but I like to pretend and prefer the version where King Naresuan’s elephant was backing away from the duel and retreating, only for King Naresuan to pour some holy water onto the elephant, say a prayer to heaven as well as some words of encouragement to the elephant. After which, the elephant was back in the fight and he managed to stop Mingy Swa’s elephant by planting his foot up against a tree, using it to push against the Hongsawadee elephant, which allowed King Naresuan to take the chance to slice down Mingy Swa. Again, I like to think that that’s what actually happened but obviously it sounds too legendary for it to have happened. 

But what do you guys think? What REALLY happened during the Songkram Yutahatti/Battle of Nong Sarai?",history
247,The presence of tiger tanks in north Africa?,"After reading ""Rommel, the Desert Warrior: The Afrika Korps in World War II"" by  Richard L. Blanco, the book disappointingly never mentions the tiger tanks reaching north Africa. i had expected atleast some mention of the tanks as they are seen in a lot of different media making their way across the desert and being the last line of defense on the Continent. That being said, the book did mention axis supply ships seldom making it to Lybia and even less so after the 2nd battle of El Alamein. so how many tigers got to north Africa and saw combat before the axis was pushed out? when did they get there? and how much of a difference did they make?",history
248,How were Italian and Germans treated in countries like America after World War Two?,"This is honestly more of a multi-question post, but I am curious about this. Many people have wondered about their treatment before and during WW2, but I've rarely heard of anything regarding those who, say, might've tried to emigrate from Italy or Germany in the late 40's-early 50's, or even those of said descents who've been here for awhile before the war.

Because of this, I have to ask:

1. Was it, in any way, shape or form, even possible to move to a country like America or Britain as a gentile Italian or German (not to argue that all Jews were probably welcomed aboard either, but that's a whole different topic for now)? The most I've heard regarding this are those who were either captured scientists who helped with the atom bomb or those who lied about their past lives (aka Nazis or fascists trying to escape justice). What would the average Italian or German citizen have to do to emigrate (again, if it was even possible)?

2. If they were able to even emigrate, what was life like for them in America? The most I've heard was that many assumed that they were Nazis or Fascists. However, I'm also curious about other things regarding their lives: If they ever did make American friends, how would they be able to do it despite hints of their country origin (such as accents)? Were jobs a problem for many of them? Were any of them denied access to certain programs or amenities because of their countries of origins?

3. Since most modern Americans don't question modern-day Germans or Italians about being fascists or Nazis, when exactly did this particular change occur (as in, when did many Americans stop to wonder if said immigrants were Nazis or fascists)?

4. Any additional info you would like to share regarding this topic?

Bonus for anyone who wants to share personal stories and/or info.

Admittedly, these are more American-centered questions, though info regarding other immigrating countries are welcome.",history

I feel like the logistical challenge of trying to supply and defend the Holy Lands from Europe after the 1st Crusade was never going to succeed from the beginning. 

Muslim armies would have had a much easier time attacking and defending the Holy Lands and as a result won basically every Crusade.

261,"Pytheas' Journey, how much is actually known?","Got a bit of a personal story to tell.

Some time ago I read the book Pytheas Journey to Thule, by Alf Henrikson. Original Swedish title: Pytheas Resa till Thule.

There were all kinds of fun stories of what he encountered during his journey. He arrives in Britain and gets a guided tour around the castle of Tintagel, where he's told the castle was once under siege by Uther Pendragon when he tried to gain the hand of lady Igraine. His companions claim to meet people like the knight Pellinore, and Ossian the great Irish skald while out exploring the British forests.

Then Pytheas manages to go past Denmark and arrives in Sweden, spending some time with the nobles in Upsal. He takes in the local cuisine, he witnesses people getting hanged as sacrifices to Odin, and much more.

He finds a wife and brings her along as he returns to Greece via eastern European rivers.

It was an enjoyable read so I planned on making a potential video about it, but after just the slightest bit of research I see that most sources online would claim his journey took him to Iceland or Norway, never all the way around to Sweden. And the Arthurian stories related to Tintagel castle seem like they might have their origins in poems that came ages after Pytheas' supposed visit.

So I've been trying to understand how much we actually know about Pytheas, to get my facts straight, and understand how much of this book was just shameless fiction portrayed as actual history. What would be the most reputable sources on Pytheas, and is it possible to find any translated versions of the original texts made by Pytheas himself?",history

I was always interested in WW2 as I think it is something we can learn so much from but sadly often chose not to. IMO the atomic bombings were a heinous crime committed by the American forces but time and time again I see people defend the decision and even go as far as to say it was the absolute right decision.

Even though I have a strong opinion on this subject I always wanted to discuss it with others (in a civil and factual way) so I could maybe understand people who have an opposite opinion on this matter or maybe even change my own opinion.

Did the ancient peoples have some understanding of chemistry that allowed them to verify if something was, for example, a pain reliever? 

How did ancient peoples even have the notion to combine copper and tin to make bronze? Hell, how did they have the notion to melt and reshape metal in the first place? Sure they could have observed lava and deduced that heat causes metal to liquify, but how did they know to get rid of purities and make better tools? Did they consciously know what they were doing, or did they just know that if they did x, y, and z somehow they'd have near completely pure copper?

280,The Toyota War,"On [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/envgfn/from_the_moment_the_germans_spotted_the_boats/), u/Talanic claims that ""Nobody wins a war by going Leroy \[sic\] Jenkins at it."" And I suppose that's generally true but I immediately thought of one counter-example: The Toyota War. It was the last phase of a long conflict between Chad (the country, not Mr. Thundercock) and Libya in 1987, and it featured a bunch of under-equipped Chadian soldiers in Toyota HiLux pickups showing up with no warning and attacking abundantly-fortified Libyan military bases defended by Soviet-made tanks and armored vehicles.

You can read about the whole conflict in Wikipedia's entry on [The Toyota War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_War), but here's the background: In 1986 the Government of France delivered 400 military-customized Toyota pickup trucks to the Army of Chad, and Chad went [Leeroy Jenkins](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/leeroy-jenkins) with them against Libya. The first strike was brutal: the [Battle of Fada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fada), in January 1987, in which a Libyan armored brigade was annihilated, with about 800 dead, and about 100 Soviet-made tanks destroyed. The cost to Chad was 18 dead and four pickup trucks destroyed.  

Next, in March 1987, an outnumbered group of Chadian soldiers in pickup trucks did the same thing to a Libyan air base, heavily fortified with 5,000 soldiers, all sorts of sophisticated Soviet munitions and even a minefield, and just took it. And then they made another successful attack in August. In September a ceasefire was pushed by the international community, France included. (France had seriously underestimated what 400 Toyotas might do to the regional balance of power and needed to put the brakes on the situation.) The ceasefire was agreed to by both sides and held. In 1994 there was a peaceful resolution to the conflict, in Chad's favor, in international court.",history
281,Single books for big historical events?,"A lot of events in history are both fairly large and important overall, but small enough that you can have a single book give a genuinely good summary of it. The one that comes to mind for me is [James McPherson's *Battle Cry of Freedom*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom_(book)), about the US Civil War. It's a single volume, but it covers a good-sized bit of history, in reasonable depth, and without cutting many corners or ignoring many important topics within the field being discussed.

I want other books that do the same thing. Where I can read a single book and feel like I really have a handle on the Russian Civil War, or Vietnam, or the Punic Wars, or anything else. Most of the ones I know are either dealing with a pretty small field(e.g., MacMillan's Paris 1919, which is excellent, but it's about a single conference), or they cover things in a way that's far too high-level to really feel like I get it(e.g., most Wikipedia articles on wars), or they're too obviously biased or limited to one viewpoint (e.g., Churchill's Second World War).

Any recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks.

282,I came across an incredibly potent quote from Madison while reading the Federalist Papers...,"
Context: Madison is discussing how political factions tend to be the death of republics...


""...the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.""

80 years before Das Kapital.

Eventually, Madison goes on to argue that the most important defense against the negative forces of factionalism is to govern a larger group of people, because the larger number of varying interests will prevent a single, large oppressive majority.

291,Why is William Wolfskill unsung?,"**William Wolfskill is a name every Californian should know. He is credited with establishing the citrus industry in the state of California. For a time his orange juice was the most popular in the United States. One of the wealthiest men of his era. His real-life actions and adventures would put to shame many fictitious characters Hollywood has created. He first made a name for himself in the fur trapping industry. He became a Mexican citizen and learned how to speak basic Spanish so that he could acquire land in California, which was controlled by Mexico at the time.**

**Later in life, he would become the largest wine producer in the region. Wolfskill developed the Valencia orange which later inspired the naming of Valencia, California. He owned a sizeable piece of land where downtown Los Angeles now stands. He first arrived in Southern California from Taos, New Mexico in 1831 using the trail Jedediah Smith had mapped across the Mojave desert. He did all this after surviving being shot in his mid-20's in the chest by a man he thought was his friend. He carried the scar on his chest from that incident until his dying day in October 1866. At the time of his death, he was producing 50,000 gallons of wine a year. He was the top producer of table grapes in California during the Mexican era. Unlike most gringos who came to Southern California at the time, he was very well-liked and respected by his Mexican neighbors because he never tried to take advantage of them, in fact, he would help them as much as possible.**",history
292,Wondering about the battles between the Saxons and Vikings. Was one of the sides superior and why did the Vikings lose many battles,"From what I know the Saxons and Vikings were nearly the exact same in terms of weapons, armor and tactics. Round shields, Arming swords, Spears and Axes. And little to no archers and cavalry. What little they had of the two was just for supporting. Also both sides used the Shieldwall tactic. 

From my understanding the two main things that decided which side won was numbers and luck. Forexample during the Stamford bridge battle. The Vikings originally had higher numbers, but they ended up being divided into three groups when the Saxons came and they had left their armor in the ships. ( This was due to that the Saxons came sooner then expected and from a different direction).

Tough talking to person today on YouTube, he said more or less the Vikings were useless in battles, lost most and the Saxons were superior. Also saying they used different tactics and gear/weapons

300,American &amp; Iranian Pilots Fought and Died together in the 70’s,"Hello R/history there’s a very little known event, or rather series of events that took place in the 1960’s and 1970’s during which American and Iranian Fighter pilots flew together, fought together and died together against the Soviets. 

These events were called Operations Ibex and Dark Gene. The US Government saw imperial Iran as an extremely important ally and bulwark against the Soviets in Central Asia. 

The US sold the Shah the best military aircraft money could buy, the Shah loved his Air Force and was a former military pilot himself. Iran bought advanced Variants of the F-5E Tiger II, F-4D and E Phantom II’s and the highly secretive and sought after RF-4E Phantom II, they even bought the venerable F-14A Tomcat to counter the high altitude MiG-25 Foxbats that’s regularly flew over Iran from the Soviet Union.  The Iranians were also the first country outside of the US to use Laser Guided “Smart bombs”. 

To go along with these aircraft the US built some of the finest military air bases ever built, and were meant to be a stockpile of weapons and parts in the event of World War III against their Soviet Union. 

Soon after the bulk of these aircraft were delivered the US and Iran started a highly secretive program using Recon variants of the Phantom and RB-57’s and RB-47’s to conduct photo recon missions over the Southern Soviet Union. This inevitably led to dogfights and aerial skirmishes between Iranian/American and Soviet aircraft and pilots. Quite a few aircraft and pilots were lost on both sides throughout the 1970’s.  This intelligence gathering greatly aided Western analysts in figuring out Soviet strengths in Central Asia. 

Another thing that might interest people is the Israeli Defense Forces Air Force and the Imperial Iranian Air Force also had an incredibly close relationship with many Iranian pilots flying Israeli F-4E Phantom II’s in Combat during various Arab Israeli conflicts.

306,WWI Military Technology,"Every historical account of WWI describes how advanced and new the weaponry was. It’s noted that no one had used these weapons in a major war yet and therefore were ignorant of proper tactics. The advanced tech and old tactics are always given as major cause for both the staggering loss of life and conditions civilians and soldiers were exposed to. 

However, I’ve never heard what the *right* tactics were. What should have been done with the technology they had available. I’m going to take a stab in the dark and say that trench warfare and blind charges into fortified positions was not the right thing to do. 

I can imagine WWII as an analogue, but the advanced in the air war changed drastically changed things. Even tank warfare (which barely existed in WWI) was such a large component to WWII. So I’m not sure WWII is a good teacher here.

311,The french and the US get a bad rep for ww2 but both of them did quite a lot.,"Ill just start with the french.

They lost fast sure, but the french government was not the reason why the french did a lot during ww2. First their surrender was probably the best thing  they could have done, they could have made it a much more long drawn out battle but ww1 was all too close of an experience people remembered what it was like and did not want a repeat. also in paris, they actually moved all their troops out if paris so that the germans could take it without resistance so that all the historical buildings there would be spared. They could have fought and made it a drawb out fight but they chose not too.

The french get a bad rep for surrendering so fast but nobody ever talks about the chaos the french resistance caused. During the invasion of italy 130,000 french resistance assisted the allies, and during normandy much like the 101st the french resistance (around 60,000) cut phone lines, destroyed fuel depots, and just generally caused mayhem which allowed the allies a much easier time invading normandy.

When it comes to the US, a lot of the supplies that kept the soviets and brits afloat came from the US lend leases. But not only that when the US joined the war, the british did not actually want to do a norman invasion, and wanted to go through the foothold they had in italy already, however that had slowed to a snails pace and the soviets were advancing fast on berlin. So by pressure of the americans, the UK agreed to a norman invasion.

The reason this is important wasnt because the germans would have won without an invasion, the russians would have eventually destroyed the reich however, much like eastern europe it is likely that most of europe would become russian communist puppets, so really the US protected democracy in europe, rather then destroying fascism.

Also the other front against japan was almost completely done by the americans (with chinese, canadian, australian and new zealands help ofc) but it was majority americans fighting and none of the invasions would have been possible without them.",history

It was not until the 10th of September that Canada, the first country in the American continent, declared war on Germany.

After each defeat I'm pretty sure most of the treaties had some sort of ""let's be friends"" clause which would be broken within a few years. My guess would be that Napoleon truly wanted good relations with Austria to legitimize his own dynasty, given that he eventually married Marie Louise and Austria had helped France during the invasion of Russia.

But my main curiosity is that how Napoleon could have ever trusted them given how many times the Austrian monarchy showed their true allegiances during the first 5 coalitions. How in the world could anyone trust them after that? Was it just hubris on Napoleon's part? Because they eventually showed their intentions once again during the following coalitions.

I read some Christmas stories about WW1 in the trenches where they exchanged gifts. An officer would let a pow go to his family as long as he returns. But I was searching for something more. Something they really adore their enemy when they're fighting or defeated them. I read about Rommel in Wikipedia and I was searching for something like that of course he is not a good example because you know... Anyways It was written there that he was respected by the british but not sure if it's true or not but I was serching for something similar. Also I can't remember the story but something like they overwhelmed the enemy position but their enemy held ground before getting killed so they gave the enemy a proper burial.

I was searching for something like that because well war is dark and it's natural for people to hate their enemies but reading about opposing sides being friendly, respecting is well strange but it's because they're following orders that they're fighting right?

349,Exactly much wealth was extracted from India from Britain?,"In the 1600’s Mughal Hindustan (now modern day India) was perhaps the wealthiest and most sophisticated empire in the world producing 1/4 of the worlds manufacture. In 1686 19 British warships, 200 cannons and 600 soldiers were swatted away with ease by the Mughal empire before the British were all expelled from Bengal (Before begging and bribing their way back in). In his history of the British East Indian Company, William Dalrymple postulates that the British East India came to enslave the nation of 200 million people by 1803 due to 3 main reasons
- The relatively spontaneous Collapse of the Mughal Empire and it’s fracturing into various factions
- The invention of the stock listed company and innovations in banking that allowed for the pooling of capital and investment previously unseen
- Technological advances in weaponry Europe over the following centuries

It took many years and many wars for the British to control, administer and rule what ended up being most of modern day India and Bangladesh.  Today India is among the poorest nations on earth despite strong economic growth in the last few decades.

350,How did the English win Agincourt if the English Longbow could not penetrate mail?,"I had always thought the vaunted English Longbow could penetrate platemail.  But I recently saw a video on youtube with a guy who is an English Longbowman.  He shot against some platemail that a smith had made.

It was interesting, but more, he failed to penetrate the plate with every shot.

This goes against what I think of English Longbowmen, and it flies in the face of what I was taught and read about the Battle of Agincourt.  In fact, if this is the case, that the English Longbow was the deciding factor of the battle does not make much sense.  It makes sense that the French knights after having taken round after round of arrows, after hitting the stationary pike walls, would have just said fuck this, and ridden back through the French lines on their way to leaving.  Perhaps they were not paid enough?  Did they ride through the lines haphazardly as they fucked off?  It makes questions..

351,Why were the English afraid of Norse Vikings?,"Apparently it got to the point that when Vikings would land, the king would organise *huge* sums of money and pay them off.

In my mind though I can't fathom why the Anglo-Saxons wouldn't be the more dominant combatants. 

- Archaeology tells us they had good metalworkers, I think superior to Nordic smiths.

- They had easier land to farm, which surely would mean more food and bigger/stronger people? 

- I *think* they were a bit more organised than the Vikings at the time, which would have surely seen them able to raise forces from across the kingdom to respond?

The only reason I can see the Vikings ever stood a chance is because of the element of surprise, it's quite difficult to respond if they've raided a basically unguarded settlement and then buggered off again.

The thing that confuses me as well though is they then started to raid Scotland, which they supposedly deemed more dangerous to raid than England. Why was Scotland seen as more dangerous? The English were a bigger nation who had pushed back and taken land from the people who the Vikings were now hesitant to raid...

I don't get it.

358,"The History of Lobster Canning — AKA, Lobsters were *never* ground up and fed to prisoners, shell and all","It seems like every single time lobsters are mentioned on Reddit, someone has to mention that they were ground up, “shell and all”, canned, and fed to prisoners.  This is always posted sourceless, highly upvoted, and seems to perpetuate as an accepted fact, probably because it’s disgusting.

In all my research on this subject, I cannot find a single source of lobster shells being crushed in the entire history of lobster canning, between a dozen books on the subject, encyclopedia entries, and two dozen articles about lobster canning.  Lobster shells are made out of chitin and are entirely inedible.  Furthermore, there is no economical reason for trying to mash up rock-hard lobster shells to ‘stretch’ an abundant product, especially in an era before industrial grinders were available.

In the colonial times, lobsters were harvested from tidal pools by hand, and were in extreme abundance.  They were fed to children, prisoners, and indentured servants.  They were also often used as fertilizer and animal feed.  According to food historian Kathleen Curtin, prisoners and indentured servants enacting laws to limit how often they were fed lobster is also a myth, and there isn’t a shred of documentation of it actually happening.

Very early canning often produced unappetizing lobster because of incomplete sterilization.  Lobsters were cooked in large vats, picked from the shells by hand, then packed in cans which were then heat treated.  Lobster had a reputation for being “green in the sea, red in the pot, and black in the can”.  The cans would also often pop from fermenting due to spoilage.  Improvements in the canning process over the years helped prevent this from happening.  In those days, a 4-5 lb lobster was considered small, and a 2 lb lobster was discarded as being not worth the effort.

Lobster’s reputation started improving when demand for live lobsters increased as an inland luxury food, and because it wasn’t rationed during World War II like most other foods were.  Ships filled with water, called ‘smacks’ to transport live lobsters instead of canned, also made them much more popular.

Today, lobsters are mostly eaten fresh, but you can still find canned lobster if you look for it.  And no, it doesn’t contain the shells.

365,A lost world: the ancient Caucasoid people who lived in China,"A lot of people are unaware that in ancient times you had mystical people, seemingly of European origin, who lived all the way in Western China. By European origin I am referring to their genetic ancestry, because these people had been living in Asia for centuries before arriving in China. If you are unaware of this it might sound like a silly crackpot theory, but just google the Tarim Basin mummies to see what I mean! Some of these mummies date back to 1800 BC.

I could go into detail about the genetics of these people and bore you with talks about haplogroups, SLC alleles and autosomnal admixtures but to summarize: they were primarily of European descent, but they mixed with local populations, meaning that had some Asian ancestry as well.

Mysterious groups such as the Tocharians, the Yuezhi, The Wusun and the Saka all lived in territories belonging to modern day China, and there are little traces of their past. Most of these people would have likely been Iranic speaking, and were related to the Scythians, known to us from Greek and Persian sources. I should stress that aside from the Tocharians and the Saka in the Khotan Kingdom, most of these groups did not have attested languages, so we cannot know for sure what they spoke.

A real headscratcher are the Tocharians, because their language shares more features with the Celtic, Italic and Germanic languages than the Iranic languages commonly spoken on the central Asian steppe.

These cultures would either be nomadic, semi-nomadic or settled people living off pastoralism, trade, and sometimes raids. The horse was very important to them, and it is likely that the Chinese got their chariots and horse expertise from early interactions with these people. The Tocharians largely lived in cities and settlements, oasis states such as Kucha or Agni, whereas the Wusun were semi-nomadic for example. These two ways of life were connected of course, since the pastoralists and city dwellers both needed each other for trade.

In the oasis states and kingdoms, the Tocharians and the Saka of Khotan got introduced to foreign culture and religion, and Buddhism was heavily practised in those regions.

Modern Turkic people such as the Uyghurs and Kyrgyz descendants these people. The Wakhi, an eastern Iranian people native to the Wakhan corridor, a rugged mountain strip of Afghanistan inbetween Pakistan, Tajikistan and China, could be considered descendants of the Saka.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *""The people have ""pig heads"", they are cunning as wolves and highly unreliable. They are very prone to pillaging, and they are as a nation typically violent.""*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Chinese sought to create an alliance with Wusun directed against Xiongnu, the Huns. To this end, the Chinese court in 107 BC sent a princess the long way from the imperial capital Xi'an to Wusun's cold rainy country.  
&gt;  
&gt;The princess wrote a poem:  
&gt;  
&gt;*""My family has married me away*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Helpless I am, can do nothing*

I attacked Cyprus as Venice in the mid 1440s. The Mamluk Kingdom, which was guarding Cyprus, declared war on me. I thought I was safe because my navies smashed theirs so their much larger army would be sitting useless in Alexandria. But no: they marched a large army across Anatolia with Ottoman permission, cross the Bosphorus, walked right across the Balkans and proceeded to set my Adriatic and Aegean holdings on fire. There’s now a massive army sitting just outside Venice which is protected from the sea. 

How realistic is this? Wouldn’t they need to be incredibly organized? How could they supply a large army with food without either raiding the Ottoman villages (which they couldn’t do) or sending ships (which they didn’t have thanks to the Venetian navy)?",history

401,"I'm about halfway through Oliver Stone's ""Untold History of The United States"" - and curious how this is regarded by historians at large.","For context, I grew up in the 70's and 80's, steeped in US propaganda regarding the USSR as an evil nation bent on world domination, and the US as honorable good guys who were justified in all actions taken on the world stage.

Even though it's been clear for a long time that popular media in the 80's included quite a bit of pro-US propaganda, I haven't really been one to sneer at this period in history, and I have generally viewed the US historically as making the best decisions that could be made in various bad circumstances throughout history.

However, watching events unfold as I've been binging this, a few things have jumped out at me.  Like how the Soviets had some pretty compelling reasons to feel betrayed and obliquely threatened by the US and Britain even by the closing months of WWII.  

Also I find Henry Wallace to be a very sympathetic historical figure in US politics who I previously knew nothing about - arguably if he'd received the nomination rather than Truman it seems clear that history as we know it from that point onward would have been dramatically different, as would US cultural norms with regard to the military and how we viewed many other nations, not only the USSR.  I was sad to see how he was shut out of politics and later shunned as a communist sympathizer.  I was similarly surprised to see that George Marshall seems to have ended his years viewed by many as too moderate due to his rejection of hawkish views, while also being a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

I'm just at the point in the series where it's started to brush against our involvement in politics in Africa and Central America, and it's continuing to add a perspective I didn't have before.

I still tend to think that hindsight is 20/20 and what seem like grave errors in policy now very well may have seemed reasonable against the backdrop of what was known then.  However, it's certainly tweaked and adjusted my view of US history and our politicians in several places so far.

So with all that in mind I guess I'd like to know - is this regarded as a quality documentary, or am I just falling prey to a well presented point of view that might not be any more objective or comprehensive than anything else I've been exposed to over the years?",history

I always got the impression that naturally in a hunter/gatherer society, the strong and capable individuals would gravitate towards leadership of their respective groups, and from this, over time, some sort of nobility would evolve, ie their familiy and close friends. But while at one point their claim might have been one of skill and capability (mostly as a warrior or warfare in general), this seems to shift towards a hereditary system where even lazy or incapable individuals stay in a position of power, because they were ""born into nobility"".",history
434,Why is Oliver Cromwell so misrepresented and misunderstood?,"He is portrayed as some sour religious fanatic like some kind of 17th century Taliban leader. I’ve read biographies and articles about him and I was surprised to find out how different he was to how he is stereotypically portrayed today. Here is numerous examples of his tolerance.

&gt;On another he wrote to defend what was perceived as a deviation from orthodoxy by arguing that ""Your pretended fear lest error should step in is like the man who would keep all the wine out of the country lest men should be drunk. It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy to deny a man the liberty he hath by nature upon a supposition he may abuse it.”

Not only that

&gt;It is useful to recall his retort in 1652 to one who declared his preference for a ""persecuting Saul rather than an indifferent Gallio""; to him, Cromwell replied ""I had rather that Mahometanism were permitted amongst us than that one of God's children should be persecuted.”

There’s much more examples of his tolerance. For instance, Parliament had the Quacker James Nayler convicted on the charge of blasphemy for merely reenacting the arrival of Christ in Jerusalem. He was sentenced to be put in the pillory and on there to have a red hot iron bored through his tongue. It was Cromwell who called for leniency.

&gt;The sad spectacle of the parliamentary ""trial"" of the Quaker James Nayler,marked as it was by numerous speeches reflecting extreme religious fanaticism, is only one among many examples that could be cited of the gap between Cromwell's views and those of the bulk of the political nation. But the plain fact of solid, personal achievement in the struggle for toleration is spread across the historical record; Cromwell's attitude toward the Jews, his treatment of individual Catholics and Anglicans in England, his concern for the distressed Protestants of the Vaudois, his conversations with the Quaker George Fox, all reflect this. The man who could protest against the application of a test of Presbyterian orthodoxy by arguing that ""the State, in choosing men to serve them, takes no notice of their opinions; if they be willing faithfully to serve them, that satisfies“ was no fanatic.

Parliament refused to back down even when Cromwell protested. And of course, Cromwell being quite a compassionate man and feeling badly about the sentence handed down by Parliament against Nayler for blasphemy tried to alleviate Nayler’s suffering.

&gt;Cromwell was left to attempt some minor alleviations of Naylor’s lot. For instance he enforced an order by which Naylor’s wife was allowed to give the prisoner supplies. In May 1657 his Chamberlain, Sir Gilbert Pickering, provided special confinement for the captive on Oliver’s instructions. One of the last public actions of the Protector (before he died) in August 1658, on hearing of Naylor’s illness, was to send his secretary William Malyn to enquire after his needs.

He was a highly religious man, but he wasn’t some 17th century Christian Taliban. He didn’t believe people should be persecuted for their religion.

&gt;It was a tribute to Oliver’s intentions at least that the French Ambassador, Bordeaux, was of the considered opinion that the English Catholics fared better under the Protectorate than under any previous Government. The immediate consequence was not only relaxation but profusion. The records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus, which had shown a mere 78 persons converted to the Catholic faith in the dark days of 1650-1, reported 364 converts in its annual letter of 1654, rising to 416 in 1655.11 By October 1655 the Venetian Ambassador was having six Masses said every day in his spacious ambassadorial chapel, all packed with English people who were using this tacitly allowed loophole to practise their religion; on festivals, there were as many as ten Masses... the evidence remains that the name of Oliver Cromwell himself was one which English Catholics had no reason to curse and some reasons to bless.

Oliver said as much himself

&gt;Oliver, as he himself said on another occasion, wished to let all live in peace enjoying freedom of religion and conscience “but not to make religion a pretence for blood and arms”

But that’s not all. He was so nice and friendly to the Quakers that they  tried to convert him despite him being a Puritan.

&gt;In 1654 two Friends took it upon themselves to try and convert him to Quakerism, and were received courteously, if ultimately put off by the argument that the Protector stood for “every man’s liberty and none to disturb another.”

Another evidence of Cromwell’s tolerance was how he dealt with ranters. Ranters were 17th century hippies. They didn’t believe in the bible or a personal god and they believed in free love and all that stuff. [No joke.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranter) Of course, Cromwell thought they were strange, but he still dealt leniently with them. And considering this was the freaking 17th century, you have to give the guy same praise.

&gt;Captain Freeman had boasted that he ‘had been a Papist, Protestant, Presbyterian, Anabaptist,’ but ‘had passed through them all.‘ and Okey, who was strict, suspected he was now a ranter. His influence over the soldiery, and his fellow officers, was also more than Okey could stomach, and he complained to Cromwell, who arranged an informal interview in the presence of other officers. If Okey expected wholehearted support, he was disappointed, for Cromwell gave a Freeman a fair hearing and allowed the captain to resign his commission without blemish on his record. In the following October, Cromwell had also dealt leniently with another suspected Ranter, Captain Covell, who was allowed to return to his charge after a private interview.

He wasn’t some 17th century Hitler or Stalin, who were quick to take offence and kill those who criticised them and their regime. Charles I use to cut the ears of those who criticised him yet Cromwell is the dictator?

&gt;It was true that those who broke the censorship laws were treated mildly: Arise Evans and Walter Gosteld, who both presented highly critical pamphlets to the Protector, commending Charles Stuart’s monarchy, were not punished. Oliver was generally supposed to be more tolerant than his Council. Robert Overton, in prison, heard that Cromwell had shrugged off one such manifestation of popular abuse with excellent indifference to satire in a statesmen. “Overton had copied out a paper of derogatory verses called “The Character of a Protector.” These had been subsequently filched from his letter-case and shown to the Protector in question. An explosive reaction might have been expected. But a friend of Overton’s told him that Oliver had merely glanced at the paper “and I believe laughed at them as (to my knowledge) heretofore he hath done at papers and pamphlets of more personal and particular import and abuse”

And, yes, Oliver Cromwell, did smile and laugh as evidenced above. 😀 He isn‘t the sour puritan often portrayed. He loved horse riding, sports and greatly loved music. The first opera in England was performed under his rule.",history

438,Where to go from Richard Miles' Ancient Worlds TV series?,"Hi all,

I'm admittedly very new to the subject of history! I never studied it in my university days, but I now find myself deeply interested.

I came onto this subreddit several days ago with the intention of finding a TV series that covered a wide span of ancient human history. Luckily, I came upon a suggestion to watch [BBC's Ancient Worlds, hosted by historian Richard Miles](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w0bl0/episodes/guide). It was exactly what I was looking for: a broad overview of events from Mesopotamia to the Sack of Rome. 

The problem is that the series ended too soon! 

Can anyone here recommend a TV series, documentary, or movie that covers a broad overview of history starting from the Sack of Rome until roughly medieval/renaissance era? 

I suppose it does not have to be a single TV series. E.g. you could recommend a series covering Byzantine era, and another that covers renaissance. 

I am considering starting [Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilisation_(TV_series)), though I worry it will not provide enough historical background.

Any suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks!",history

455,I just discovered World at War (1973 documentary on WW2)?,"I’ve previously watched a significant amount of film regarding WW2 from documentaries to cinema, and I can honestly say, this documentary has captured me in an entirely new way. 

It goes through the history of WW2 a couple months a time theatre by theatre and starts with the build up to WW2. What’s incredible to me is that as opposed to new docs released these days, many people who lived through these experiences at the time, including key decision makers, were still alive and well in 1973. The format of the doc is a mix of historical footage, narration, and many in person interviews with such people, from those on the ships at Pearl Harbor, to those in Hitlers bunker with him. The best part about this is that you get small tidbit stories that don’t make it into most stuff these days, like the story of the Chaplain walking the deck of the USS West Virginia at Pearl  Harbor saying “Praise the Lord, Pass the Ammo!”

Highly recommend this documentary. Adjusted for inflation I believe I read online it’s one of the most expansive documentaries ever put together, and was the most expensive production in Britain at the time (total of 900k pounds in ‘73 dollars).

- May 26, 1637 Massacre at Mystic

- January 25, 1787 Shay's Rebellion: The First American Civil War

- January 24, 1848 Gold Rush

- September 17, 1862 Antietam

- July 6, 1892 The Homestead Strike

- September 6, 1901 The Assassination of President McKinley

- July 21, 1925 Scopes: The Battle Over America's Soul

- July 16, 1939 Einstein's Letter

- September 9, 1956 When America was Rocked

- June 21, 1964 Freedom Summer

In the introduction, they point out that due to current event bias made them not include anything after 1965 which was a great idea imo. They also point out that they weren't going with easy days like the 4th of July or the Pearl Harbor Attack but instead with slightly lesser known events that have caused ripples and charted a different course for America.

I didn't put a blurb about what happened in those particular dates as the chapter titles do a good job about explaining what happened that day with the exception of September 9, 1956, which was Elvis' appearance on Ed Sullivan and the ramifications of that.

459,What were boarding schools for girls like in late Victorian and Edwardian times?,"This interests me greatly, but obviously there’s very little on girls specifically and school stories of the time (such as A Little Princess) aren’t very specific nor accurate, I suppose.

All I can gather is that having a governess at home was preferable for the upper-class and due to mandatory education (in the U.K. anyway) many poorer children attended local day-schools where there was usually one large class which encompassed all age ranges. Richer girls obviously also had the choice of private day-schools where they’d do needlework, play tennis and learn foreign languages and all that sort of thing.

I have also read that boarding schools were considered more ‘caring’ and had a ‘family-like’ atmosphere in comparison to the Victorian seminary. 

So I’m interested in the day of upper-middle class girls who would’ve attended boarding schools. What the classes were like, age-ranges for the schools, etc.

474,Mysterious cave with ancient drawings in my hometown,"Greetings guys!

I live in the small town in western Serbia which has a large hill splitting the town in two. 

This hill is called Djulim which is a derivatory name from turkish djul which was, as far as i know, garden of roses.

However, this hill has a neckton of myths that surround it. The reason why is because there are numerous caves in all different sides of the hill, some filled with water, some empty and some are ruins of an old antimony mine. But, in several of these caves there are inscriptions that look extremely old and odd. Similar to cave paintings that you see in history books, yet different. How? Well...

Some of those drawings include two-headed people, gigantic tiger like creatures but with horns and coloured red, weird symbols that differ a lot from local known existing cultures, and, most interesting ones, dates. Earliest one being written is 323. AD and newest one being 1873. 

In 1974. team of Yugoslav archeologists from Belgrade came here and wanted to explore this caves, and after doing a carbon analysis they found out that all of the inscriptions, including dates (written in arabic numerals) are, at least 1000 years old. Odd, right? Well prepare yourself...

Two months after investigations started, numerous citizens reported glowing light from the cave that occured for couple of minutes and then stopped. Next couple of weeks, archeologists found a passage, tight and narrow, which had drawn depictions of people drowning in the cave and depiction in old slavic alphabet saying “Ones who seek shall drown”. Several weeks later, biggest flood ever (well, at least until 2014) has struck the town, and caused errosions which closed the enterance to the cave, leaving an opening size of the average dog.

Investigations have stopped due to this events and no one ever came back to explore this cave.

Today, the opening is still visible and a vast ammount of drawings can be seen with flash turned on, including most of the ones mentioned above.

Some say the cave is a tomb, some say it’s a maze, some say it’s time portal and stories go on and on.

If anyone is interested, i can take some pictures tomorrow and edit them into this post.

What do you think about this? Do you have any explanations behind this?

477,The German invasion of Denamrk and Norway,"Hi. On april 9th 1940 Nazi Germany invaded the then neutral Norway and Denmark. Their pretext to invade was to \`\`Liberate\`\` them from the british. Denmark with its flat terain capitulated in a 6 hours and Norway with its mountainous terrain capitulated in 5 weeks.

But why though. Its more expensive to maintain a long coastline that stretched from Spain to Russia.  

I think that the allies could have landed i either Denmark and Norway and not France.

482,looking for information on the Roman Domitian games (Capitoline games) Roughly 70AD,"I've heard that roughly around 70AD a man named Domitian ruled Rome. He believed himself to be God and ordered a game in his honor. Apparently he split Rome into 12 districts requiring two people from each (yes I know, very hunger games like). After they would fight to the death there would be four people left on four different colored horses. They would then ride and fight to the death with the last person alive being given citizenship in the capitol. Then two people on horses with the masks of death and hades would go and collect the dead bodies.

Animosity between the Nazi regime and Wehrmacht leadership is well documented, so I'd assume their loyalty lay with Germany and the German people and not the political elite.

Paulus accepted the reality in Stalingrad and surrendered. Why did none of the others when the Soviets were on the doorstep of Berlin and the Western Allies had crossed the Rhine?

503,Count Franz von Harrach rode on the running board of the royal car serving as a bodyguard for the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. His account begins immediately after Princip fires his two shots:,"I first heard this quote from Dan Carlin and it always felt like such a powerful moment of history. Just in case you don’t know the story, they attempted to assassinate him with grenades in a parade I believe. After that failed and the archduke left he went into the city. There in the city in some smaller ally his car stalls. As the car coming back on, one of the people from the group trying to assassinate him happens to be walking past and sees him. This is from the viewpoint of the Archdukes bodyguard.

&gt;""As the car quickly reversed, a thin stream of blood spurted from His Highness's mouth onto my right check. As I was pulling out my handkerchief to wipe the blood away from his mouth, the Duchess cried out to him, 'In Heaven's name, what has happened to you?' At that she slid off the seat and lay on the floor of the car, with her face between his knees.

&gt;I had no idea that she too was hit and thought she had simply fainted with fright. Then I heard His Imperial Highness say, 'Sopherl, Sopherl, don't die. Stay alive for the children!'

&gt;At that, I seized the Archduke by the collar of his uniform, to stop his head dropping forward and asked him if he was in great pain. He answered me quite distinctly, 'It's nothing!' His face began to twist somewhat but he went on repeating, six or seven times, ever more faintly as he gradually lost consciousness, 'It's nothing!' Then, after a short pause, there was a violent choking sound caused by the bleeding. It was stopped as we reached the Konak.""

This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure you it is grimly accurate.
We have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still have any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one atomic bomb fell on that city.
Before using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which they are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition the Emperor to end the war. Our president has outlined for you the thirteen consequences of an honorable surrender. We urge that you accept these consequences and begin the work of building a new, better and peace-loving Japan.
You should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war.

Naoroji and Bhownaggree became MPs during the Victorian era for both the Liberal party and the Conservative Party.

I'm admittedly way more knowledgeable on 19th/20th century western history, so building a list was pretty easy - there was a clearly defined algorithm of 1) Known authors 2) cost on Amazon (Kindle), and 3) a ratio between my desire to learn more about a particular president and the number of pages in the book.

For Greco Roman history, I know basically nothing but have always been fascinated by it so want to learn more. Obviously I won't go leader by leader, but are there particular books or authors that I can't miss? Timeframes I definitely need to read to understand what comes next? I'd be cool with anywhere between 10 and 30 books probably, and would definitely want to do them in chronological order again.

Being a millennial that has always lived in city environments, I naturally have no concept of how anything came to be except out of a store in plastic packaging. :P So, as the title goes, how did dark/middle ages blacksmiths and armorers get their raw materials? Did they have to do the smelting themselves, or was there some medieval equivalent of a smelter/ironmonger/wholesaler where they could get semi-usable material?

I hadn’t heard of it before.  Basically, it happened just after the Soviets had pushed Germany back from Moscow.  In the retreat, a massive salient was formed, and the Soviets, feeling they were on a roll, threw as much as they could to crush the salient.  Germany was prepared.

The battles happens over a 15 month period and casualties  (dead, wounded and missing) were:

Germany - 650,000 (according to Germany)

USSR - 2,300,000

Sending some troops to an island. I know that this was a secret mission and there was also a change of command ( and not sure if it was presidential or perhaps a general or something) nobody knew about this mission. Because of the secrecy and lack of communication the Americans didn't get the much needed help or perhaps they weren't supposed to go and never got word.

548,How lethal / dangerous were ancient slings? What amount of kinetic energy does it take to break bones / kill people with blunt force such as stone shot?,"I recently read about Balearic slingers who could supposedly throw volleys of stone shots up to 400 meters distance

&amp;#x200B;

[Here I was able to find a video from Tod's Workshop where he measures the speed and provides the weight of the stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BehBbNQRjXw)

&amp;#x200B;

80 gram stone shot with about 35 m/s speed, which is 50 Joules of energy. He admits he is not a good slinger and mentions that there are people who claim speeds of 50-60 m/s which does not seem unreasonable. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Here I found a video where a slinger named Luis Pons Livermore showcases his skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCZaDLQCPlY)

&amp;#x200B;

In this video it shows he is slinging the stones at a speed of about 180 km/h which is 50 m/s, although it does not specify the weight of the stones unfortunately. Assuming it would be about the same weight that Tod is using in his video (80 grams), Luis would be generating 100 Joules of energy. I would imagine ancient Balearic slingers could generate even more energy then this as they practiced every day.

I've scoured online sources, but unfortunately sources are sparse as Japan's post war economic miracle seems to take up the limelight.

Some questions I'm having right now:

Why did the Japanese and Italian economies collapse?

Why couldn't these governments with strong central authority, and in Japan's case, near fanatical support from the people, simply continue to produce weaponry on a mass scale despite an economic meltdown?

Why do food shortages have such an impact on economic meltdown?

Does economic collapse deal more with the workers refusing/being unable to produce weaponry, or with the collapse of the supply side chain behind delivering the raw material to the factories?

On the 8th of May, the Soviet Union had 11 million soldiers in Europe. The United States had 4 million, growing to 7 million when combined with troops from Britain and France. There were also close to 3 million German POWs still fit for duty in American hands that could theoretically be organized under their command. They had another 5 million troops in the Pacific, which would need several months to redeploy to the old continent. So the Soviets had an initial advantage in army divisions, while the Americans were superior in strategic bombing. Nuclear weapons would probably have been used on European soil only if the situation became truly hopeless. Would the Western armies have been able to hold the line long enough for additional support to arrive? And once reinforced, would they have attempted a counter offensive into Eastern Europe?",history

Dating among all time periods.,"Hunting seems stereotypical when thinking about both former aristocracy and those thinking they are living up to their ancestors standards today. There are countless paintings of chases on horseback and preys in front of beautiful landscapes. All across europe every hour with the car you pass a 'Jagdschloss', palace-like residencies with the biggest use having been solely accommodation for aristocrat hunters and their parties following a successful one. 

Has it, hunting, always been part of it?

(pers. exp.): Having been thrown into the lion cage that is a boarding school, but coming out of a perfectly average middle class household, I have always been wondering what it is that people that are in the seats 2-8000 in the line to the british throne have that makes them so obsessive with hunting. If it is simply something given to them by their ancestors, how could that possibly have developed itself? Why not like theatre play, planning barbecues or stick with horse breeding completely? 

The question doesn't concern the obvious answer like ""they had the land"", ""the right"" and ""the ability"", but also the written down (?) motives, the difference to other aristocrats/nobility and the mindset (powerplay?) behind it.

582,The worse school shooting in the history of Canada : The shooting of Polytechnic,"The shooting of Polytechnic (La tuerie de l’École polytechnique in French) is a tragedy that happened in Montreal on December 6th, 1989. Marc Lépine, a 25 years old man, entered the school with a carbine and a knife and opened fire. His targets where mainly female students, because he hated the feminism that some woman showed. In less than 20 minutes, he killed fourteen young women that were students in this school and injured thirteen other students, four young men and nine young women. The shooting started a bit after four o’clock. 

In more details :

At four o’clock PM, Marc Lépine entered the building with a white bag and sat down for multiple minutes, not responding to the personnel’s questions. He then walked in the building before entering a class on the second floor. The class was composed of about 60 students when Marc Lépine entered it. He told the students to separate into two groups, woman and man. Since no one was taking him seriously, he took his gun and shot a bullet towards the roof of the class. The nine women were told to stay in the class while the men were ordered to get out. He then asked if any of the girls knew what they were doing here, and everyone said no. He then answered that he was fighting feminism. A girl answered that not all of them were feminist, and that they were just students that were studying engineering. Lépine answered that they were girls that would become engineers, that they were just stupid feminists and that he hated feminists. He then opened fire on the group of girls, injuring 3 girls and killing the other sixth. Lépine continue his rampage in the corridors, injuring three students before trying to kill a young girl twice. Knowing that he was running ou of ammunition, he went back to he stairs were he left his white bag and went back to the class were he had fist entered. The door was now blocked/locked, and he tried to open it. He shot three times on it before abandoning and continuing his walk in the corridors. He injured another person before killing another woman that had just locked the door to her office. He went to the cafeteria, where a hundred of students panicked and ran towards the exits. The kitchen of the cafeteria had been locked, so the students had no other choices but run. A woman played dead on the floor, and Marc Lépine shot the woman right next to her. He injures another one, kills two girls that were hiding in a storage room and spare two students that were hiding under the tables because they accepted to show themselves when he asked for it. He goes up to the third floor, injures 4 other students. He enters another class, opening fire on the students and killing four women and injuring 3 other. He stabs one that was pleading for help after being injured, and, finally, after all of that, takes of his cap, surrounds his gun with his coat and shoots himself in the head. He still had sixty bullets in his white bag.


Victims :

The majority of them were students, but some of them were working at the school. All of them were women.

583,"When did the world ""learn about"" the effective genocide in Maoist China?","I've been reading a few books by EF Schumacher in the past week and while he is overall tremendous (though his predictions for the world's demise seem to be a few decades early), he bafflingly praises Mao as late as the mid 70s for the development he brought to China, seemingly unaware of the tens of millions who died. 

The only way I can seem to reconcile this with the rest of his ideas, which are largely against centralization and very pro-human, truth and harmony with nature, is that the world simply didn't know the details and extent of what had happened until much later. I also haven't really learned anything about Maoism yet, so is he simply praising Mao's ideas/writing and unaware of how they weren't actually put into action? 

Here's an excerpt from a speech he gave:

&gt; You can't be alive today without being interested in China, because it's the biggest transformation that's happened in the twentieth century. This enormous country, sick unto death for so many decades, suddenly, in one generation, turns itself around. People are fed, cheerful, everybody's at work, enthusiastic, they're all drably but adequately clothed, children are in fantastically good shape, full of buoyancy and cheerfulness. If you compare that with China in the 1920s and 1930s, it's a miraculous transformation. It's 
still a very, very poor society. But it's a poor society where the basic requirements are being met. 

&gt; Various things have happened. Virtually from the demise of the Manchus in 1911 until Mao in 1948-49 were years of the most intense suffering. Out of this suffering there were born some people, undoubtedly of quite extraordinary intellectual power and stature, such as Mao and Chou En-lai, and they have built a new society there. As an economist, I would say what they have done primarily is to turn economics the other way around. Our type of economics says, ""You mustn't do anything, mustn't produce anything, unless you are quite sure you couldn't possibly buy it cheaper from outside."" When I was in Puerto Rico, a luscious island, I found that the carrots were imported from Texas! You mustn't produce carrots in Puerto Rico if the Texas-produced carrots are cheaper. That's our system. The Chinese have turned this around. They have said, ""You mustn't buy anything from outside unless you can be quite sure you can't make it yourself."" It's as simple as that. When you say, ""You mustn't produce unless you are quite sure you couldn't buy it more cheaply"", then development is impeded. On the other hand, when you say ""you mustn't buy it unless it is really impossible for you to make it"", economically speaking everybody is challenged, everybody is busy.

585,Lincoln's Lyceum Address,"I first encountered this when I got curious about the intro of Titus Andronicus's A More Perfect Union. It's well worth reading and here's an excerpt:

At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it?-- Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant, to step the Ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never!--All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Buonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.

At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.",history

587,Did the U.S. Constitution supplant our Western concept of virtuous people and virtuous leaders? Did our forefathers inadvertently supplant virtue with the law?,"I've come across this narrative several times, most recently in a WSJ book review by Samuel Goldman on 12/27/19.  It goes something like this: in the old days, nobility believed in the concept of virtue, even if they didn't practice it.  This was a significant part of Western political ethos, and John Adams believed that virtuous and wise people cannot be subjected to tyranny.  But when the law began to take hold in Western Europe and North America, virtue slowly gave way to law - so that one could whatever as long as it is legal! 

Again, I've come across this narative several times, and am getting a little tired of it because I've found no evidence in the history of America or UK (I am that knowledgeable in French, Spanish, Dutch or German histories) that somehow law or our American constitution superseded the value of virtue in our societies and politics. In fact, our laws and constitution were founded on virtue and wisdom.

598,A question about the Inquisition and forbidden Arabic texts.,"This question came up to me while I visited the Inquisitior's Palace of Malta. In the 16th century, when it was constructed, and from then on, their palace served as the siege for punishing heretics and Christians who possessed forbidden literature, including but not limited to Arabic texts. Now I realized that while in Spain it's understandable for people to want to hide Arabic texts, given that the moriscos, or ex Muslim who forcefully converted to Christianity, tried to save their heritage/knowledge , property, or even try and hide the Qa'ran from the Inquisition, it's seems stranger on Malta.
Why would Maltese have Arabic books in their possession? Could some happen to be able to read Arabic (given that at least orally Maltese is close to Arabic, given its origin), or was it solely to make sure that merchants weren't trading with the Ottomans?",history

602,Chinese Revolution,"Chapter I
1922-1937
Life for the Chinese masses was enduring miserable horrible suffering and at the end of the day very had little more then that to expect come the next. The starving peasants crawled across the street many were homeless and unemployed and those who weren't worked like slaves in horrible conditions. The government was an autocratic oligarchy made up of the feudal lords. While it was now the 1920s as far as the Chinese people were concerned that might as well have been the 1420s. There was horrific suffering, famine, disease, and tyrany. Many historians refer to this period in Chinese history as ""the Warlord Era"" due to the fact that the state had pardoned many politically powerful mass murderers who now terrorized the Chinese masses. Only about 10% of Chinese children were able to receive an education past what their parents could teach them and medicine was no better than in 1700s.

Prostitution, poverty, and violence were all common place. There was a fear of the horrific govornment which existed in a disturbing superposition of anarchic and totalitarian. But despite all the horrific suffering of the Chinese people at large the ruling elite (ie the former feudal lords and members of the former empirial family) used slave labor to ensure that they lived a quality of life comparable to their European counterparts. A national currency that exists but it was only used by the richest 5% of the population The peasants on the other hand used food and firewood to barter.


Chapter II
1930-1939
Not surprisingly the Chinese masses started to strike and riot, their leader was a man in his 20s named Mao Zedong he was an incredibly well-read intellectual who spoke Mandarin, Cantonese, and English (he also spoke Latin, Russian,and Georgian but not well enough to hold up a conversation); he had read to teachings of history's greatest philosophers but among them his favorite was Karl Marx, for Karl Marx had published political theory that was not a philosophy but a science direct dialectical materialist analysis of history, not as much an invention as it was a discovery.

Fearing their overthrow the leaders of the Chinese government banned the Communist party, but the masses did not give up so easily and continued to riot demanding a better life. Mao himself had retreated into the jungles where he lived amongst the most impoverished and outcasted of the Chinese peasantry; first he learned from them, then he thought them. By 1937 the people's revolution was on the brink of victory when Japan invaded. Mao made a temporary truce with the ruler of the Chinese regime in order to fight a greater evil.


Chapter III
1939-1948
In 1939 Germany invaded the rest of Europe starting WWII, the war between Japan and China had previously been called sino-japanese war but was now seamed part of a larger conflict. Churchill offered no assistance to the struggling in desperate Chinese people and FDR didn't even care about the war yet. All hope seemed lost and talk of surrender began, but Mao said the following ""We shall heal our wounds, we shall gather our dead, and we shall continue fighting!""; the Chinese masses were inspired by these brave words from their leader and managed to hold out. Churchill and FDR had both shown apathy to the struggling Chinese masses, but Stalin did send reinforcements to help them. In 1941 both the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. had entered the war; by 1945 the Axis powers had been defeated.

The U.S. had resorted to the immeasurably cruel act of using a nuclear weapons on civilians which struck fear into the world. The U.S. abruptly started sending soldiers in as renforcements for the old Chinese regime. Mao and his comrades were begining to progress against the old regime; a very high ranking U.S. general named Douglas MacArthur suggested they drop 50 nuclear bombs on China, as disturbing and horrific an idea as that may seem the U.S. actually gave it legitimate consideration, eventually they decided not to and the U.S. agreed to let the Chinese people live in peace. How horrifically close the U.S. came to actually dropping those bombs is what made the Soviet Union decide that it was necessary for them to develop their own atomic bombs, in 1948 the ""Cold War"" began. On October 1st of 1949 Mao Zedong declared that the People's Republic of China was now in existence 🇨🇳.

I’ve been reading up a little, apparently Merlin would not yet have been developed as a character, though the mythological stories of Welsh and Roman heroes who would later become Merlin were around. Elves were believed in, and were seen as fair, white humanlike people, beings capable of inflicting sickness on humans. Dragons would not be seen as dinosaur-like beings with four legs and wings, but instead were thought of as large serpents. The ancestor to the word “dragon” wouldn’t even be used, and wyrm would be more common. Folk magic was used to treat illnesses and such. I’ve seen some bestiaries mention fauns as presumably real creatures.

605,Invention of wagons and the beginning of the use of bronze tools,"The wagon was invented in 3500 BC and the Bronze Age began in 3000 BC. A remarkable aspect of its invention, noted by David Anthony, is that it took barely a few centuries for it to diffuse from as far as Denmark to Iraq, indicating that this was a breakthrough technological achievement. And indeed it was complex engineering, it wasn't simply a matter of cutting a round piece of wood and sticking things together.


I know that the Bronze Age permitted for the first time the use of metal tools, especially tools to cut wood in exact fitting shapes. This allowed people to go from rafts and canoes to ships made of tight fitting planks with hugely increased carrying capacity. My question is what do we know about the interplay of bronze know-how and the wildfire-like diffusion of the wagon in those few centuries before the Bronze Age started. The wagon would have been a perfect candidate to kickstart the development of bronze making. It was evidently something that suddenly everybody wanted, as evidenced by its wildfire-like diffusion in a few centuries to every corner of west Eurasia, and it was at the same time something that would have either obligatorily required bronze tools or at least would have benefited hugely from their usage because of the need to produce parts of exacting dimensions.",history

Is that because it just got lost in the shuffle and overshadowed by its larger cousins Germany and Italy?

611,Napoleon: A Life by Andrew Roberts completely blew me away,"https://www.audible.com/pd/Napoleon-Audiobook/B00OSJZ7BQ

There are times when my brain tends to *devour* various historical sources, biographies, lectures, or encyclopedias. If a subject matter or time period fascinates me, I’d probably look for mediums that’d help enrich my engagement.

As for *Napoleon: A Life*, I stumbled upon this biography in Audible. Like anyone else who’s a fan of history, I already *knew enough* about Napoleon, but I didn’t *know everything.* So, I thought the audiobook would provide some worthwhile tidbits of info.

33 hours later, and I couldn’t believe how much about the man — this historical figure who casts a looming shadow due to his accomplishments (and his missteps) — I hadn’t discovered yet until that point.

I learned of how he acted like your quintessential lovestruck and hopeless romantic, almost r/niceguys material, especially with his desperate letters to Josephine.

I found out how the British had captured some of these letters and published them to his embarrassment. Yet, at the same time, some Brits also saw him as a sympathetic figure in spite of never-ending wars. Napoleon even managed to charm enemy sailors as he was being taken to St. Helena.

I learned of his passion for history, and how much he had admired Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire, and, as such, wanted to emulate the successes and legacies of the man and the realm.

I found out how he tiptoed from casual observer in Corsica, to full-on revolutionary in France, to, later on, realizing how chaotic and anarchic these changes were, to the point that he also couldn’t resist the allure of power.

I heard of the massive changes, meritocracy, and sweeping reforms which are still considered as cornerstones for many of the institutions in modern-day France and other European nations. I knew of some of these already, but never ways that fully explained the gravity of these changes.

I learned more about Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of the French marshals who never got along with Napoleon. The guy ended up marrying Nap’s ex-fiancee. He was later offered the Swedish crown (the Swedish king had no heirs and parliament wanted to have that French military zeal). He accepted and, a couple of years later, joined yet another coalition *against* Napoleon. He was instrumental in defeating Napoleon’s other marshals prior to and during the Battle of Leipzig. Oh, and his descendants — the House of Bernadotte — still rule Sweden to this day. Yes, the Swedish royal family is descended from one of Napoleon’s marshals who basically had some random noble go: “Hey, fella, wanna be king? We really like you, monsieur.”

I heard more about Napoleon’s family: his siblings whom he placed in positions of authority despite not having the same charisma or skill, and even arranging a marriage for one of his brothers to his step-daughter. What the?

Oh, and the glorious battles of the Napoleonic Wars. From Arcole to Acre, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, the Peninsular Campaign, Borodino, the disastrous retreat from Moscow, and, of course, Waterloo. I had already known about several of these battles, but never in so much fascinating detail.

I’ve read numerous biographies and history books over the years. There were very few that left a sombre note  — you felt as though you’ve gotten to know so much about an individual, that, once you’re done reading/listening, it felt like waving goodbye as well. This was one of those occasions.

I've done a bit of research through Wikipedia on the partitions of Poland, but haven't been able to find much more than it got recreated after the first world war, but I haven't been able to figure out why anyone bothered that long after the fact. I didn't know if maybe the Polish peoples fought in the war and wanted compensation, or if the area was just unstable, and they wanted to stabilize it, or something else entirely.

I know Napoleon had briefly created the Duchy of Warsaw in the early 1800s, but my impression was that it was a short lived affair that does little more than hint that a national identity hadn't been extinguished by that point.",history

619,What decides the name when two or more rivers meet at the confluence point? Is Ganga really the longest river in India,"As a general rule  when two or more rivers meet at the confluence point: it is either the volume of water or length of the merging river that decides the name of the new river. 

However then why we see so many anomalies to this rule especially in ancient civilizations, surely a few can be explained by some old mythological reason, probably a few to some ignorance of those times but certainly not so many. 

 Rivers as part of our geological phenomenon is constantly changing &amp; evolving which means that the rivers are constanty changing their course (both length &amp; direction) and also changes are being brought about in their water flow levels 

The rivers are many millenia old &amp; their status, names that are given to them are equally that old &amp; hence these names don't change as dynamically &amp; relatively frequently (when compared to the age of the rivers) when the status or position of the rivers change. Nowhere is this more exmplified than in ancient civilizations that are many thousands of years old like in India, where we see these anomalies abound, like in Prayagraj at the confluence of Ganga &amp; Yamuna etc.

626,A few facts about alcohol prohibition in Russian Empire/USSR and presumable connection with significant events that followed.,"In 1914 Nicholas II in order to prevent excessive drinking in the Russian Army during the WW1 issued the decree to restrict the production and completely ban the retail sale of vodka, making it available only in restaraunts as an exclusive upper class perk. 3 years later he was executed with all his family by an angry sober Proletariat mob.

Effective 1985-87 Dry Law by Horbachov significantly restricted retail sale of alcohol, shut down specialized liquor stores, enforced punishment for drinking, destroyed vineyards and production facilities. The law in fact had made vodka an actual legit currency, alternative to worthless Ruble, since everything was in deficit during Perestroika. 4 years later angry Soviet mob demolished the empire and discarded the whole communist dream in pursuit of accessible booze and other sought-after nice things.

Pictured below is 7 kg cast iron ""Medal for boozing"", introduced by Peter the Great in 1714 for excessive drinking, awarded by the local police. It was meant to be carried a week long on the neck, and is considered the world's heaviest medal. Needless to say that Peter himself was a notorious alcohol enthusiast.

629,How Alcohal Prohibition in the US helped Canada,"When the United States introduced the prohibition of alcohal, it was still legal in Canada.  So many smugglers would go to Canada, buy what they want from liquor stores or bars, and then smuggle it back to the U.S.  

This was such a big money maker that Al Capone himself had his mafia dig tunnels in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan to help with the smuggling.  With some saying that Al Capone was in Moose Jaw sometimes.

Now of course the U.S government didn't like this so they told the Canadian government to crack down on it.  But since it was during the Great Depression and all these sales were giving the country money, the Canadian government just turned a blind eye and pretended that it was not as bad as some thought.

So basically, a law ended up helping another country make money during the depression.",history

633,The first strike in America! A story of International Solidarity and Voter disenfranchisement in 1619,"The first documented strike in North America. Skilled craftsmen were sent by the Virginia company to Jamestown to produce pitch, tar, and turpentine used for shipbuilding. (""From Forraine Parts"" non-English Europeans at Jamestown, 1607-1625 - Bill Wardr) Early in the history of English colonization especially at Jamestow, the charther companies and leaders such as John Smith would recruit workers from mainland Europe to come to build their new colony: Contemporary historical accounts refer to this first group of foreign craftsmen as Dutchmen and Poles([Smith, John (1624). ""VII"". The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles-The generall historie of Virginia, New England &amp; the Summer Isles, together with The true travels, adventures and observations.](https://www.loc.gov/resource/lhbcb.0262a)) These laborers started producing comedies such as glassware, pitch, and potash, important because they were the first goods exported from the colony to Europe. When the first elections in the colony were held in 1619, the colony did not allow any continental settlers to vote. They were denied the right to vote on the grounds that they were not of English descent. The craftsmen in response, refused to work unless they were given the right to vote. Under this labor pressure, the Virginia Company's Council reversed the decision to disenfranchise the craftsmen, and simultaneously struck an agreement with the craftsmen to apprentice young men from the colony. The company leaders feared not only the loss of income and labor, but that the colony might gain a reputation for not being welcoming to further settlers not of English descent, especially skilled craftsmen.

644,Term Limits in the early republic,"I wonder why there weren't any term limits written into the constitution - this was first done with the 22nd amendment after FDR had been elected to his fourth consecutive term. Taking into consideration how afraid the founding fathers were of tyranny, it would seem natural to have written something about it in the constitution. 

I've done a fair share of research on the topic and have found out that whilst Washington only served 2 terms it wasn't actually him who started the so-called two-term tradition. That was Jefferson, who was very outspoken on the matter and was a proponent of introducing term limits. 

Whilst there were many branches of government, especially local that had term-limits this was not the case for the presidency and I wonder why?

One explanation, which Washington himself gave was that if a candidate was fit to run for a third term and was very well-liked, he shouldn't be considered un-fit because of the mere fact that he was running for a third term. Secondly, the constitution had enough power to overthrow a potential tyrant, making having a specific amendment on the matter obsolete. 

I would still like some other perspectives on the whole term limits concept and would love to hear some of your thoughts on the subject.

Looking from a modern perspective, it would seem extremely hard to endure the hardships that people went through back in the Medievil time. But wouldn't everyone in the Medievil era be facing the same issues so the intensity of the hardship be normalised?

I ask this because if I ask you to think back to a time where there were no cars you would think ""oh wow, that is so ancient"". But then if in the future spaceships fly everywhere from planet to planet, people in the future would think ""wow people back then only had cars?? So ancient.""

671,"Pargali Ibrahim Pasha - underrated great military leader, politician, diplomat, Grand Vizier of Ottoman empire","Well known as the most famous and tragic Ottoman grand vizier, long life best friend of sultan Suleiman .

He practically ruled the world most powerful empire of 16th century, together with Suleiman from 1523 - 1526.

Due to long term influence and intrigues of Suleiman beloved wife  Hurrem, who intrigued against Ibrahim because he supported Suleiman first born son Mustafa, seed of the discord against pasha was sow. She convinced sultan that Ibrahim want to take sultan place. 

During the campaign against the persians, Ibrahim used the title Sultan. However, Suleiman promised Ibrahim that during his reign, Ibrahim life will be safe. 

Sultan asked his wisest advisor about the way how he can execute Ibrahim. 

He was adviced that because he will break the promise given to friend, he must build a mosque for Allah. 

Before the execution, sultan dinnered 7 times with his life long friend, hoping he will flee and give Ibrahim a chance to kill him. 

Ibrahim , although he probably knew whats going on, stayed at the palace near sultan. 

At 7th day, Grand Vizier was found strangled at his chamber. 

Suleiman never totally recovered from his best friend execution, expressed his sadness at poems, refused to rule the empire for the while mourning for Ibrahim.

Ibrahim Pasha was also extreme capable military leader, even better diplomat and politician.

His military leader portfolio

1521 - Siege of Belgrade

1522 - Capture of Rhodes

1525- Traveled to Egypt after Ahmed pasha rebellion reformed local provincial civil and military administration system.

1526 - MOHACS battle, served as the leader of Ottoman army, had biggest part of the army at command, played major and  active role at the one of the most impressive military victories of all time, personally led forces to battle, fought himself according to legends.

1527 - Dealt with Sah Kalender rebellion against Ottoman empire politics, used diplomatic and and leadership skills

1529- Led the army during siege of Vienna, which many consider as the defeat of the Ottoman , while Ottomans claimed it as a victory many times

1532 - Siege of Guns, leader of  an army, Ottoman fortified position at Hungary , captured several fortresses

1534- succesfull campaing against Safavid dynasty at Persia, captured Tabriz and Bagdad, u to 1535, when he was called back to Istanbul

As you can see, thats pretty impressive portfolio, i would say much better than some Nazi generals, whose are much more praised as the leaders.

As a diplomat and politician Ibrahim was even better dealt many profitable trade pacts with Venice or France. He was also patron of art and culture.

Considering his military campaign portfolio, him ruled the Ottoman empire for 13 years and diplomatic success, he is one of the most fascinating historical figures for me.",history

On Wikipedia there is mention of use of tourniquets as far back as Alexander the Great ([https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield\_medicine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_medicine)), the invention of the stretcher in 1380, this sparked a few questions, and thought this would be a good first place to start for asking some questions.

Given massive hemorrhage has been pretty much the number one reason of preventable death on the battlefield throughout humanity, and if compressible hemorrhage was possible back then, when did junctional wound packing become a thing? Closer to the times of firearms?

If any, what was the predecessor to a pressure bandage, or was amputation the result of tourniquet application back then?

Using flame during sieges, I assume soldiers occasionally got inhalation or facial burns. Along with facial burns, facial trauma (such as a sword slash to the lips/nose) preventing a patent airway, was there any treatment to open up airways back then? Something similar to a cricothyroidotomy? Maybe even NPAs or OPAs?

When did ventilators begin? I assume they go far back, as they are simple to make (probably could make one out of pig skin, like an American football), and casualties would probably complain of shortness of breath, and, grand civilizations such as the Romans or Greeks could find a solution.

With the invention of plate armor, as well as blunt force weapons, pneumothorax, I suspect killed quite a few after battles, when did needle chest decompressions or chest tubes (or any treatment for pneumothorax) begin?

686,Why didn't HW Bush take down Saddam's govt during Desert Storm?,"In hindsight, this seems like it was a pretty wise decision - taking out the government left a situation where the various factions in the region, the Shia and Sunnis in particular, inevitably waged a civil war against each other for control of the country. Were these social tensions among the Iraqi population appreciated by the first Bush administration? Did they assess at the time that Saddam's removal would have left a civil war in its wake? 

On the other hand, by leaving Saddam in power, did they create an unsustainable relationship between Iraq and the US, ultimately leading to the invasion 12 years later? Could diplomatic relations between the two countries have been repaired after 1991, leading to a peaceful resolution? Or did HW simply postpone an unavoidable regime change?",history

It refers to an incident where [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) is stated to have visited the [Temple in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem), where the courtyard is described as being filled with [livestock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock), merchants, and the tables of the [money changers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_changers), who changed the standard [Greek drachma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma) and the Roman [Sestertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sestertius) and [Aureus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureus) for [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekel) and [Tyrian shekels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_shekel).

How interchangeable were ancient and medieval currencies?

* The Drachma and Sestertius were made of Silver. The Aureus was made of Gold. The Shekels were made of either Silver or Electrum. One can see that having non-interchangeable currencies made of different materials required money changers.
* In [*Imperator: Rome*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperator:_Rome) currency is named ""Gold"". Was Gold really recognised as a baseline for the value of currencies in the ancient era?
   * If 2 countries both had currency made gold (or if they both had currency made of silver), does that make their currency readily interchangeable? For example:
      * If a trader had [Gaullic Gold coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_coinage) but not Roman Aureus, could they have bought goods with an identical quantity of Puranas in a Drachma-using area?
      * If a trader had [Indian Puranas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_of_India) (Silver) but no [Greek Drachma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_drachma) (Silver) or Shekels (Silver), could they have bought goods with an identical quantity of Puranas in a Drachma or Shekel-using area?
   * If currencies weren't interchangeable, what's the point of even having separate currencies if it would consist of Gold or Silver (both rare metals) just like other nation's coinages?
* If coins back then were made of gold and silver, when did nations decide to start stabilising their wealth by storing gold bars?",history

Now that we stand on the brink of the next step of the evolution of cars (electric cars) one of the most common things you hear is that there is not enough Places to charge it. You can charge a gas car anywhere but there is not nearly as many electric charging stations as gas pumps.



I think this is an odd point to make as it must have taken a long time to build up the refuilling network that currently exists today.



Therefor what u wonder is if anyone in here know how long it took before the ice really catched on and how long it took for the refuilling network to be sufficient enough to make longer trips.

I'm trying to find out the size of an average Mongol clan before the time of the Mongol Empire, when they were unified.

I've only found information regarding the army sizes during the Empire: "" A Mongol cavalry army rarely exceeded 10,000 riders in any one place at one time, even the very largest campaigns such as in Europe probably contained only three such 10,000-men divisions (*tumens*), the rest of the army, perhaps triple the size of the Mongol cavalry in some cases, was made of allies who conducted warfare according to their own traditions"" ([source](https://www.ancient.eu/Mongol_Warfare/)). This suggests that there were several units at once and also that a campaign usually saw 10,000 men plus 30,000 allies.  
I would imagine such sizes would have been impossible to maintain pre-unification. The upkeep would probably have surpassed what a single nomadic clan could do - food, weapons, horses and so on. (Which makes me wonder how khalasars in ASOIAF/GOT could manage to keep 40,000 riders but that's a different story).

I did find some information about the Xiongnu state in 209 BC-93 AD: 166 BC, there was a 140,000 size cavalry. In 158 BC, 2x 60,000 cavalries. In 121 BC, an army the size of 40,000 men. But again, those were somewhat unified in a ""state"". 

So I'm curious to know if anyone has some numbers that could be compared. Less than a hundred? Hundreds? Thousands? Ten thousands? There probably were bigger and smaller clans, so that's why I'm asking about an average.",history

I'm thinking that the first Washington Naval Treaty from 1922 also lent a hand towards this since it seems to me like it was another case of the major Allied states forcing or taking things from the others by putting shipbuilding restrictions on how much the power of the other Allied states could grow. It also seems to me that Japan especially would take offense to the later treaty restrictions from the 30s, since it also limited their intended shipbuilding designs such that most WW2 Japanese destroyers and cruisers would suffer weight balance issues from cramming firepower onto a limited weight hull. It also seems to me that neither France nor Italy paid much attention to the later treaties as well, due to their mini arms race when France built the Dunkerque-class of battleships to which Italy responded with the Littorio-class and then France in turn responded with the Richelieu-class.

Alternatively, is there any indication that things might be different or not change at all if the naval treaties from the 20s and 30s weren't ever signed?",history

I’ve heard Arab countries and Turkey are similar - that establishments to which the name or tradition of coffee are attached mainly purvey tea. 

Many people with whom I chatted with either don’t see any mystery in this (their lack of curiosity annoys me) or blame it on the British: the Brits marketed their tea from India all over the world, including in the Mid East. So tea replaced coffee as the predominant drink in the Mid East.

I told her that I would have assumed that Reindeer were unknown in the Eastern Mediterranean because they didn't live there, but I also am not too sure. After all, the Romans were known for [Bestiarii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestiarii), performances where animals are to fight condemned criminals or professional combatants. Roman leaders would show off their conquests bringing live animals to Rome and displaying them to the public, for example, Julius Caesar exhibited a live [giraffes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe) in Rome in 46 BC. Therefore, would the Romans have known about Reindeer, even if just as an animal which they could use in Bestiarii?

781,About feudal hierarchy,"First of all, I understand that feudal system was never clear cut, but still I want to make the most sense out of it.

So I was reading the wiki page about the peerage of the kingdom of France, it says “The prestigious title and position of Peer of France (French: Pair de France) was held by the greatest, highest-ranking members of the French nobility.” And The traditional number of peers is twelve. They are:

Archbishop-Duke of Reims, premier peer

Bishop-Duke of Laon

Bishop-Duke of Langres

Bishop-Count of Beauvais

Bishop-Count of Châlons

Bishop-Count of Noyon

Duke of Normandy

Duke of Aquitaine, also called Duke of Guyenne

Duke of Burgundy

Count of Flanders

Count of Champagne

Count of Toulouse


So half of the peers are counts or bishop-counts, while a lot of dukes didn’t get admission into the peerage. And when I examined the map of France of that age, it can be seen that many of its counties are not noticeably smaller than some of the duchies. So why were those large and apparently powerful counties not promoted to duchy level? And when the count of say champagne met a duke who was not a peer, who outranked who?",history

This made me think, knowing that the USA likes to involve itself with most matters around the world (not saying this is a bad thing whatsoever) how did the USA, both the people and the government during that time, respond towards what was going across the pond during ""The Troubles"" and did Americans ever get directly involved (such as supply weapons to the IRA or individuals volunteering)?

Looking back at historical film and photos I see a lot of service members lighting cigs up whenever they had them or had a chance to smoke one.  In trucks, in admin offices, around base, but never in planes (for obvious reasons).  But I have yet to read of any direct accidents attributed to the smoking of cigarettes.

I’m Lucas Richert, the historical director for the [American Institute of the History of Pharmacy](https://aihp.org/) at UW-Madison, a nearly 80-year-old institute dedicated to advancing the knowledge and understanding of the history of pharmacy and medicines. I’m also co-editor in chief of [Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/shad/pr/180921) and author of a new book with the MIT Press called “[Break On Through](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262042827/),” which draws on archives and government documents, medical journals, and interviews, and interweaves references to pop (counter)culture to historicize the radical mental health practices in the 1960s and 70s. I published another book (“[Strange Trips](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Trips-Regulation-McGill-Queens-Associated/dp/0773556370)”) earlier this year that focuses on the contentious relationship between scientific knowledge, cultural assumptions, and social concerns. My hope — particularly with “Break On Through” — is to promote the discussion of mental health by placing the histories of American mental health, pharmaceutical use, and intoxicant use in dialogue with one another, all within the context of mainstream and fringe therapies.
 
Questions about the history of drugs or pharmaceuticals? The field of psychiatry in the 1960s and 70s? Over the past few years, I've written and taught about how and why we control and regulate drugs in CANADA and the US. And I've tried to understand the major swings and struggles in modern mental health care.  I’m here from 1 – 3 PM EST — ask me anything!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

The Ngô brothers have been sold for a few dollars.""[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Nhu#cite_note-jg2-96) When asked if she wanted [asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum) in the United States, she said, ""I cannot stay in a country whose government stabbed me in the back.

 Probably the two greatest modern inventions: the ability to capture sound and image. The former captures sound waves, ""etching"" them onto a cylinder and later a disk and later on being able to play it back. The latter captures light, captures the image as is and etches it onto a light sensitive paper. Both of these things however were invented only 200-300 years ago.  


Could they have been invented much earlier, say the medieval period, where some civilizations had some 'advanced' knowledge of alchemy (examples include alchemy in Islamic world and gunpowder in China)? And at least for photography, the concept of camera obscura already existed, all that was needed was knowledge of certain chemicals that react to light.

821,Why did efficient medicine just developed in the last 150 years of history and not before?,"So, here's a topic for discussion. If there's been 5.000 years of documented history. There, if you trace the advancements in all sciences or branches of human knowledge, you can see that engeneering has steadily improved since the dawn of history, as well as astronomy, chemistry, literature, philosophy, etc. Humans started with stone tools, then copper, then bronze, then iron, then steel, then compound materials... Medieval scientists discovered and classified distinct chemical elements, and every discovery added up to the one before it. One man postuled that Earth was round, then another added ""it moves"", and later another ""around the sun"". It was an adding of layers and layers of research.

But that's the thing with medicine. It seems to me that medicine didn't really improve and get better until 150 years ago. Holes in your head were replaced by consuming mercury pills or getting your blood sucked by leaches. Physicians could do little to nothing to really cure people for almost five millenia, and it doesn't look like any doctor in history built upon earlier discoveries, but each one looked at nature and got their own conclussions from there.

It appeared in 508 BC. I also looked for the origins of the Roman Republic, because even though it wasn't exactly a democracy (but not even Athens was a full democracy for modern standards), it at least had the seeds of some important things that are tied to democracy (even today), mainly: the division of power, the election of leaders and the term limits.  

To my shock, it seems the Roman Republic was founded almost together with Athenian democracy (actually even a little earlier) in 509 BC! So we had two different civilizations giving birth to a somewhat modern type of rule almost at the same time. I know the two systems were very different, but they also have things in common so maybe it wasn't just a coincidence?

Given that people from the West could apparently (relatively) freely go into and out of East Berlin, I was wondering what was stopping the West from simply issuing valid papers for East Berliners, and someone taking these across the border to the East?

I guess that the East would stamp them on the way in and out - but presumably this would be relatively easy to fake too.

So why would the Western Allies only declare war on one of the aggressors? This is especially puzzling considering that Churchill was a staunch anti-Bolshevik.


Edit: So the running theme in the comments is that there was no practical means of waging war against the USSR due to geopolitical reasons. Germany was perceived as the bigger threat and it was understood that the nonaggression pact would fall apart sooner or later.",history

There were many pagans there at that time, but by 1387 when the Lithuanians finally converted, there were none left to fight. So the Teutonic Order spent their considerable resources warring with Christian states like Poland and Lithuania.

At some point Poland made an offer to the Teutonic Order, a land swap for territory adjacent to non-Christians. I'm imagining possibly for Moldova or just east of there on the Black Sea, which would put the Teutonic Order both adjacent to the Ottomans pushing North through Wallachia and adjacent the Crimean Horde raiding from the East. The Order rejected the offer and continued to war with the Poles until their downfall.

I was never able to find answers to:

- What was the exact offer? 
- Why did the Order say no? 
- What did the Pope think of it? 
- What did other Christians think of this? Were they scandalized by the Order's refusal to focus on non-Christians?",history
840,Was the ancient city of Rome easy to siege?,"I have been studying Greco-Roman history in my free time, and I have observed that the city itself was attacked many times, with different outcomes every time. During ancient times every big city was extremely difficult to take, for example the sieges of Jerusalem and Alexandria (Both cities had populations of haundreds of thousands) were a very hard fought sieges, and other cities like Syracuse and Massilia were also quite hard to take.

But the case of Rome is not the same. As far as I know, these are some of the attacks the city suffered:

\- (Semi-legendary) Siege of Rome of 508BC, War against Clusium led by Lars Porsena, the siege ends with a peace treaty

\- (Semi-legendary) Sack of Rome of 390BC, after losing a battle a Gallic army led by Brennus takes Rome (except the palatine hill), initial defeat, but they win after an outbreak of plague and the arrival of Camilus with an army.

\- In 280BC Pyrrhus has the chance to attack Rome, but decides to retire for several different reasons (I'm not sure why)

\- In 216BC Hannibal has the chance to siege Rome,  but decides that is too risky.

\- In 87BC Sulla marches on Rome without any difficulty.

\- In 49BC Ceasar marches on Rome without any difficulty.

\- In 410AD (I know that in this era the city was semi-abandoned, but it had some impressive fortifications), the city is sacked after some days of siege.

\- In 455AD is taken and sacked very easily.

And after the fall of Rome Belisarius was also able to take the city.

So my question is, why was the city Rome so poorly defended during these occasions?",history

846,How true were Rudolf Franz Ferdinand Höss's statements during the Nuremberg trials (war crime trials for Nazi Germany post WW2)? Why did he speak about the destructive capabilities of Aushwitchtz in such a matter of fact manner?,"Rudolf Höss was the longest serving commander of Aushwitchtz who testified during the Nuremberg trials.  The most infamous statements to come out of him were:

"" I commanded Auschwitz until 1 December 1943, and estimate that at least 2,500,000 victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease, making a total of about 3,000,000 dead. This figure represents about 70% or 80% of all persons sent to Auschwitz as prisoners, the remainder having been selected and used for slave labor in the concentration camp industries. Included among the executed and burnt were approximately 20,000 Russian prisoners of war (previously screened out of Prisoner of War cages by the Gestapo) who were delivered at Auschwitz in Wehrmacht transports operated by regular Wehrmacht officers and men. The remainder of the total number of victims included about 100,000 German Jews, and great numbers of citizens (mostly Jewish) from The Netherlands, France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Greece, or other countries. We executed about 400,000 Hungarian Jews alone at Auschwitz in the summer of 1944.[46]""

When accused of murdering three and a half million people, Höss replied, ""No. Only two and one half million—the rest died from disease and starvation.""

Later on in an essay he revised his death tolls

""I myself never knew the total number, and I have nothing to help me arrive at an estimate.

I can only remember the figures involved in the larger actions, which were repeated to me by Eichmann or his deputies.

From Upper Silesia and the General Gouvernement 250,000

Germany and Theresienstadt 100,000

Holland 95,000

Belgium 20,000

France 110,000

Greece 65,000

Hungary 400,000

Slovakia 90,000 [Total 1,130,000]

I can no longer remember the figures for the smaller actions, but they were insignificant by comparison with the numbers given above. I regard a total of 2.5 million as far too high. Even Auschwitz had limits to its destructive capabilities.""

And a transcript of his testimonu hear: https://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/04-15-46.asp.

I wanted to know How true these statements were found to be? Why was Höss so matter of fact about the destructive capabilities of the camp?  Was there anything he deliberately hid with regards to the operations of Aushwitchtz?",history

Wikipedia notes that ""In 1870, only 10 percent of Africa was under formal European control"", yet by this point most of the rest of the world was already divided up by colonial nations.

Background: I always loved the story of Les Miserables, a major section of which (spoilers for a 1862 work of fiction?) revolves around revolutionaries defending a tiny barricade based in a neighborhood bar/meeting house. I'm familiar with one rather different story of a handful of people defending a single building; Pavlov's House in Stalingrad, but that is rather a different matter, as that city was in a state of seige, rather than revolution.

I have particularly enjoyed reading about how the role of the state change especially regarding the start of the welfare system in the UK, including the introduction of pensions, free school meals, national insurance and time limited unemployment benefits, but everyone seems to say this happened for a different reason.
The reasons I’ve heard are
-The rise of the Labour Party and the threat it posed to the liberal government
-The Boar War as it showed the health problems and made welfare an imperial concern
-The expansion of the electorate to include a working class majority

So my question is, do people have any other answers to why the role of the state changed or an opinion as to which is the most important?
Also, did the role of the state change in any other way than welfare as I’d love to look into that too?!",history

885,"How have the world wars affected French culture, specifically family culture?","My wife is French and being American, my experience with French culture is that they’re amazing people but also generally tend to skew a little bit towards being critical of each other and the world, a bit cold, and overall more traditionalist/risk averse. I know every culture has its nuances, but I’m curious from a historical perspective where these traits might come from. 

My hypothesis is this: they had been a major power in Europe and the world for much of the past few hundred years and with that comes a good amount of pride. Then World War One happens and that takes a massive toll in terms of lives, wealth, world outlook, pride, and I’m sure many other things I’m not thinking of. My understanding of WWI is that the French lost considerably more than some of the other allied forces, but I’m not sure if this is accurate. Either way, only two decades later, they get hit again, but simply don’t have the resources or will to go through all that again and so have to surrender. Having been a major power only 50 years previous I can see this being another huge source of pain and shame. 

All of this is to say that I can imagine parents in the 1910s through the 1950s not being in exactly the best emotional state to raise children. I can see all of that trauma maybe being passed down to their kids, and then their kids’ kids and so on, with each step manifesting itself in some sort of cultural resentment towards life/the world but without a clear source.

However, by researching more about this period, about battle of Sekigahara, I'm starting to wonder, was it really like how it is represented in the video game? Is Ieyasu a traitor?

889,Appeasement policy,"The British discussed many ways to keep Germany from attacking them. Either through economical ties, territorial concessions  (infamously the Sudetenland, or a bit discussed through colonial concessions) and through guarantees(Poland, Czechs).
But William Rock puts it in his book ""British Appeasement in the 1930s"" that the British took the decision to ally themselves with Poland, instead of the Soviet Union 

In short: After the Munich Agreement the people thought that the appeasement policy needed a new initiative, bc. Germany wasn't tied down and now violated the Munich Agreement by invading Czechoslovakia and the western powers not doing anything. So the British under Chamberlain wanted to ally France, the UK, Poland and the UdSSR to keep Germany down. But Poland didn't want an alliance with Russia.

So France and the UK had to decide between Poland and Russia. They choose Poland.

Why did they do that? Russia seems to be the better economical and militarily ally, so why was Poland choosen?",history

892,When did the English begin branding enslaved Africans with marks of ownership?,"Hey all! I’m trying to figure out if African slaves were ever branded with marks that showed ownership between 1650 and 1670, and how common (or uncommon) it was. Examples from Barbados, Jamaica or Virginia would be appreciated.

I’ll begin with what I do know.

- By the early 18th century, there were many accounts of slave brands. Whether they were marks of ownership or something else, it’s tough to say (I didn’t see any slave brands matching their owner’s initials, albeit I took only a cursory look through the compiled list). Many brands were noted in this list of Jamaican advertisements for 18th century runaways: https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00021144/00001 (found via u/RTarcher ‘s wonderful answer to a similar question. Check it out here if interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/72sb1f/were_slaves_in_the_americas_and_caribbean_branded/). Unfortunately, I’ve been unable to find a similar document covering the period I’m exploring.

- In the Barbados Slave Code of 1661, a slave could have his face burned by hot irons as punishment for assaulting a Christian. In 1643, Virginia passed laws that two-time runaways are to be branded on the cheek with the letter ‘R’ (there were also instances of this punishment being used for white indentured servants). Unfortunately, neither mention branding used as property.

- The Spanish *seemed* to use branding to mark ownership of indigenous slaves during the 16th century. Slaves brought to harvest pearls in the waters of Cubagua were ‘marked on the face and on the arms by a hot iron with a letter of C (whose meaning we have not been able to verify but may have been a mark for Cubagua)’, as per Aldemaro Romero et al. in the article *Cubagua’s Pearl-Oyster Beds: The First Depletion of a Natural Resource Caused by Europeans in the American Continent.*

This shows that branding was used in my period of interest – but was it used by the English to show ownership?

If anyone has any information on this topic, or accounts of branding slaves for reasons other than punishment from 1650-1670, your help would be greatly appreciated. Historical documents/accounts would be fantastic, too. Thanks for reading through!",history
893,"Reasons for sub saharan Africa slower historical development compared to East Asia, Middle East, India, and Europe?","I admit I know little about pre-20th century sub saharan Africa. I'm currently reading Guns, Germs, and Steel and I'm perplexed why southern Africa was not further down the technology, ""development of society"" path than it was when European powers swept in. 

It seems it has the natural prerequisites: land for growing crops, large animals for domestication, natural ores for metallurgy, has large areas of lands easily connected (i.e. not separated by mountain ranges or other such isolating terrain-- other than the Congo basin perhaps), and early presence of humans. They weren't even so isolated as to suffer from a lack of new ideas like civilizations in the Americas-- trade from Europe and Asia occurred at least as early as the Roman Empire. 

So why was southern Africa lagging behind in terms of technology and society advancements: poor centralization, writing systems, few (any?) cities, little outside exploration, early middle ages level weapons, etc?",history

896,Why didn't more French Nobles try to escape early on during the French Revolution?,"I was just reading a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/076790818X) which mentioned the French Aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier. He was instrumental in advancing chemistry into the modern age, but as he was involved in the Ferme générale, he was guillotined.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the book says that Lavoisier and his (also scientific) wife ""...were making rather tardy plans to slip away to Scotland, Lavoisier was arrested"" (Bryson, 132). This was after Marie Antoinette had already been beheaded. The text also mentions that ""In May he and thirty-one fellow farmers-general were brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal...""(Bryson, 132). This would mean that many other nobles and such like had waited for a long time before attempting or planning to (or not even attempting or planning in some cases) escape.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, why didn't more nobles and other targets of the reign of terror try to flee when they could or as early as possible? Was it arrogance, and they just thought that they were safe? Or was it fear, and the worry that if they escaped, they would be caught and executed? Or was it just plain difficulty, and it was simply too hard?",history
897,Does the prevalence of privately-owned weapons affect the effectiveness of a resistance movement?,"I am visiting my cousin's house and he is a fan of [*The Man in the High Castle*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle_(TV_series)) on [Amazon Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime). In short, the story is set in a USA that lost World War II and got split between a Greater Nazi Reich in the east (with [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) as its regional capital), the Japanese Pacific States to the west (with [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) as the capital) and separated by a neutral zone that encompasses the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains).

However, that series reminds me of this quote:

&gt;You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.

That quote is often attributed to [Isoroku Yamamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoroku_Yamamoto), but after searching it up today, I learned that [it is likely a fabrication](https://www.factcheck.org/2009/05/misquoting-yamamoto/).

Have there been historical cases where the high prevalence of privately-owned weapons have made a resistance movement very effective? Likewise, have there been historical cases where the low prevalence of privately-owned weapons have made a resistance movement very ineffective? Would it be fair to say that high prevalence of privately-owned weapons matters more if these privately owned weapons are firearms?

On a similar note, since resistance movements have weapons such as firearms, what happens to all the civilian-owned firearms once the war is over? For example, Poland and Vietnam both had very large armed resistance movements, but once the communist governments took hold and instituted strict gun control laws, how did they go about getting rid of all the guns owned by all these battle-hardened former resistance fighters?",history

914,Mutiny on the Bounty: my take on why it happened,"&gt;**Disclaimer:** I don't think we'll ever *know*. This - along other presumptuous theories (e.g. Sir John Barrow's) - are product of the narrative fallacy more than anything, ~~like 95% of history's ""whys""~~, but fuck it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Context:** For those unfamiliar here's the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty) about the Bounty.

**1) Fletcher Christian had borrowed money from his Captain**. Bligh, comfortable being a purser, was very ""conservative"" in his finances. When with the Dutch after the mutiny, he forced his officers to grant him their will and power of attorney (in case of their death), as a guarantee for the money he lent them (""My shekels, sir!"").

Back then, a gentleman's word carried weight. Demaning such vexatory guarantee made one of his officers (theassistant surgeon) write home in outrage. It was also said by  the patriarch and mutineer John Adams that Blighwould remind Fletcher of his debt whenever they clashed.

**2) Bligh treated his officers as students.** It was good practice and expected of a senior officer to mentor their subordinates (specially midshipmen). However, Bligh may have been somewhat excessive in his ""lectures"".

When sailing with his nephew as 3rd Lieutenant and second in command, Bligh wrote home that he was a very happy with the nephew performance.  At the same time, the said nephew wrote home claiming his uncle was insufferable and impossible to take orders from. Know who said the exactly same thing? Fletcher Christian, his second in command on the Bounty, while being praised by his mentor.

**3) Absence of marines and commissioned officers on the voyage**. This one is self explanatory, poor Bligh didn't have a single courageous arm to lend a hand.

**4) The gentlemen on his ship didn't have a ""stake"" in their country**. Idiotic as this may sound now, the major guarantee of loyalty and diligence from the officers was their ""stake"" in the country - i.e. their financial and social interest in their success.

Not coincidentally, every gentlemen who partake in the mutiny was from a poor/disgraced family: Peter Heywood's father was a bankrupt and a embezzler, Fletcher Christian's was bankrupt and Ned Young was poor and a mixed race bastard.

**5) Tahitian Pussy.** According to the historian Ray Person, [lack of pussy is the root fucking cause of all global instability](https://youtu.be/OubHHtNM94s?t=64).

Seriously, now. Several officers were bewildered by the sexual liberty of Tahiti and, at the time of journey back, they were unwilling to go. Caroline Alexander in her book points to an aborted desertion attempt from Heywood and Christian, during their sojourn on Tahiti.",history

917,What is the most interesting history fact you've ever learnt? (Can be something personal or just a fact)," 

Personally the most interesting thing I've learnt is something personal which lead to a whole lot more about the man Rudolf Hess.

My grandad was put on duty whilst guarding Rudolf Hess (deputy fuhrer from 1933-1941) in Spandau, in the 60's and documented how he was just a solemn old man walking around the courtyard twice a day. I found this really interesting as my family don't really have cool stories like this and WW2 and the Nazi parties infrastructure was something I was interested in before knowing this.

Immediately I purchased three books about the man, one documenting his earlier life, another documenting his flight, and the final of which, which I have just finished, about a man of Jewish descent that was under Hess' protection from the Nuremberg Laws and Nazi discrimination.

Albrecht Haushofer was a diplomat and member of the German Resistance. It was interesting to learn how the Deputy Fuhrer's flight had many consequences for a family under his protection as the Nazi's disowned Hess. He was kept as a prisoner at Moabit Prison after being found hiding in a friend's farm by the narrowest of margins in December 1944. He was important for peace talks at the start of the war and Himmler kept him around for such purposes in case needed. Towards the ending of the war, as the Nazi's were getting desperate and the Allies were closing in around Berlin, they started releasing prisoners and sending them home.

The next part really shocked me and simply demonstrates the desperation and the cruelty of the Nazis.

As the allies were closing in on Berlin, Albrecht wrote multiple letters to his father, Karl Haushofer, as hope grew and chances of escape looked likely. On the night of the 22nd of April, he and multiple other prisoner were led out of the prison. They got all their clothes, valuables and money given back to them. They signed a document saying that they had been released and received their possessions. They were escorted out of the prison and then suddenly multiple SS officers surrounded them. All hope they may have had, was shattered in an instant as they were backed into a wall. Gunshots broke loose and all were executed, except one. One of the men were shot in the neck but miraculously survived. After being kicked by an SS officer who then said ""this pig is dead"". After this the SS left the crime scene and the event was documented by the sole survivor.

It was just something I found really interesting and shocking at the same time and I'd love to hear about your less known/favourite facts in history.

I just read more about this. I feel like it is a huge misunderstanding that many people say Japan was never colonized/conquered or resisted Western influence before the Meiji Restoration. 

From what I see, Tokugawa Japan was economically bankrupt and militarily weak in the 19th century. The US, British Empire, France, Netherland, and Russia simply walked into Japan, occupied certain strategic regions, did businesses with loyal locals and forced the Shogunate to sign unequal treaties. All of these are definitions of a protectorate like French Indochina or British Egypt except Japan was divided by those Western nations. Tokugawa Shogunate was on its last leg, while the invaders simply waited a moment to seize complete control over Japan. 

In the wiki article, it also addressed many Japanese intellectuals were deeply shameful of being dominated by foreigners, and this motivated a lot of them to conduct the Western study. It was fortunate that Choshu and Satsuma domains were Westernized enough to bring Meiji back to the Imperial throne. Who knows what will happen if they failed?

933,Did private enterprises exist in communist China?,"I'd like to start off by saying my undergraduate degree was in history. I later went back to school, and I am now getting my Master's in Accounting next spring. My understanding and grasp of the economy has increased tenfold, and it's also added a lot of complexity to the ideas I had of what I believed to be **communism** and **capitalism**. When we are children, we are given a very naive narration of history that paints one, more or less, as the ideology that is ""pro-markets"", and the other, ""pro-state"". Feel free to disagree with this designation, but understand that I am pointing out its clumsiness.

I have a hard time believing any society is strictly one or the other (market/state based, that is). But what I can't fully appreciate is how comprehensive the state acting as a replacement for a market economy in a country like, say 1950's communist China would have been. The one-sentence definition of communism is (again, feel free to disagree) a system in which the state owns everything. Intuitively, this can't be possible in any society which has a currency. Yes, you could argue the government **owns** the money, but this is a moot point; fiat currency backed by the full faith of the U.S. government doesn't make the bills they issue any less fungible in a market.

All capitalism is, from an accountant's perspective, is a system in which those with control of assets, or resources, or skills of any kind can exchange them for currency. Accounting is the tool by which one measures whether or not their cost of doing business, exceeds or subsides to, the profit arising from that business. Both the costs and the profit must be recorded in the same currency. If your costs exceed your profit, you are insolvent. But, if profit exceeds your costs, you are a capitalist. Essentially anyone who grows their wealth over time by having a positive equity balance (more assets than liabilities) and profit (revenue above and beyond the cost of doing business) was capitalist in nature.

I guess my real question here is, in communist China, what happened to these people? Who audited people or businesses to see if they were profiting off of something/someone? Couldn't you still become wealthy if you were good at exchanging things for currency? Were formal legal business entities not allowed? How did they collect taxes? Were there both sales and income taxes? What the hell was the economy really like?? I can't imagine a world in which a capitalist can't theorhetically practice capitalism.

Ive recently read where Jackson crossed certain rivers in my area and even read where he camped along some of those rivers. Then I came across Major Howell Tatum's Journal to General Jackson. He was apparantly a topogrogpher traveling with him and he mentions camps, road, river and their crossings in detail, the problem is the names of most of the streams have changed, the two main rivers are the same. I know he traveled from Fort Stephens and mentioned the area within 5 miles or so of where he crossed the river, but the names of all the creeks have changed. I can take an educated guess on the roads since Fort Stephens is point A and the Chickasawhay river crossing is point B. I guessing the Old Post Road and ridgerunner roads. It i could just get the name of the creeks Id know exactly where he turned from south, headed west and crossed the river.",history

Is the difference in the fate of two languages due, at least in part, that Persia was a major power up right up to the time they were conquered by the Arabs, hence one would conclude that their language and culture were stronger at the time. Whereas Egypt had been a declining power for centuries by then. This is just an educated hypothesis. The point of this post is to get more feedback. Thank you.",history

960,The History behind the legend or myth of Asuras &amp; Devas. Also who were the Devils?,"Asuras are often shown in Indian mythology as evil characters &amp; unruly features, ferocious characteristics. However in reality they were the people from Persia &amp; their gods during the Vedic times who were referred to as Asuras (probably some of the most good looking people).It was a case of showing. According to some genealogy studies &amp; writings, Kashyap Rishi during the Vedic &amp; the Avestan people (Persian) shared a common ancestry from the Rishi himself.

Like in any family after a period of time the progeny settled in different parts of the land &amp; started to progress from there on. Infact in the early part of Vedas many Vedic Gods were referred as Asuras including Indra who is one of the most important of them all in the Rig Veda. So in essence intially the relations were harmonious and word Asura was used as a mark of respect &amp; honour. However later on conflict between the two increased over generations &amp; this ultimately led to a big war of Dasarjana or in other words called ""The Battle of Ten Kings"", post this war which the Vedic tribes under the leadership of ""Sudas"" won decisively thereby firmly establishing the Vedic Kingdom in the what was then known as the Brahmavarta region (region between the now dried up Saraswati &amp; Drishdhavati rivers) led to continued hostilities  between the two tribes that really never ceased conclusively atleast till the end of the Vedic period. It was in this context then that the word Asura was started to be used in a negative connotation.

The origin of the word Deva is less clearer as there are few cases behind its etymology that has to be studied in more detail. However according to an old mythological story of Samudramanthan (don’t know its exact underlying historic background from where this very popular mythological story emerged) . This was a contest between the Devas &amp; Asura to churn the ocean and retrieve a nector that would give them eternal life.

The Vedic people in form of their deities ""The Devas""  were able to get their hands on the nector which was then called Sura (was a drink &amp; probably could have been alcohalic in nature) while the Avestans were unable to do so &amp; hence they were called A-sura i.e. people without the nectar of life.

As was the case with Sapta Sindhu (term given in the Rig Veda by the Vedic people themselves to the region of their influence) where in Iranian pronounciation of that time it was called Hapta Hindu i.e. ""S"" being replaced by ""H"", similarly the Persians referred to their respected ones as Ahura again ""S"" being replaced by ""H"" &amp; later on when Zoroastrianism was firmly established their highest deity as ""Ahura Mazda"".

Hence as the Vedic people used to look down upon the Avestan or Persian people as historic mortal enemies &amp; use the word Asura in a negative sense in the same vain the Persians used to look down upon the Vedic people &amp; many of their deities who the Vedic people called as Devas. Hence ""Asura"" in the Vedic culture especially after the war became a pejorative or negative term in the same way ""Deva"" in the Persian or Avestan culture became a pejorative or negative term as it happens in any conflict where both sides try to show the other in poor light.

Also one interesting trivia out of this whole episode is the case that as in the case of ""Sapta Sindhu"" which the Persians pronounced as ""Hapta Hindu"" &amp; from there used to refer to the people of this area as Hindu &amp; the country as Hind, the europeans adopted the term as pronounced or mispronouncced it as Ind/Indie &amp; from there came the name of the nation state of Bharata as ""India"". Similarly since the Persians used to use the word ""Deva""  to describe Vedic deities in a negative sense the Europeans again adopted it and from there came the modern word of ""Devil""!!!

When the Romans built an earthen ramp and reached their defenses, they committed suicide.

Now, I am neither a military nor a Jewish historian. What I am wondering is that was there a scenario in which these brave fighters could have fought to the last man standing instead of committing suicide? The latter is a sin in Judaism, right? A related question is, would we categorize those fighters on nationalist or religious terms?

Final question is, as far as rebellions against Rome go, was this one of the more significant ones in Roman history. I know that Judea killed off one whole Roman legion before Rome took revenge. Was such victory, at least initial victory, achieved by other Roman subjects. I think the Germans wiped out one or two Roman legions. By the way, in the Forum in Rome, I've seen an arch that celebrates Rome's victory in its war with Jewish people. So it was a big deal for Rome.

**Loss of Greek and Latin scientific texts after the fall of the Roman empire** 

Viking raids on English monasteries destroyed countless copies of classical works, and devastated the English scholarly tradition. It is not an exaggeration to say the Vikings crippled scientific development in England for a couple of centuries, by casually burning or stealing books, and by murdering the people who read, studied, and preserved them.

&gt;  
&gt;Sawyer, Peter H. *The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings*. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1997.

Nevertheless, some of the English libraries still preserved classical texts, and libraries in continental Europe remained well stocked. The real problem was not that the texts were lost, but that they were in Greek, a language which had almost completely fallen out of use in Western Europe. So Western libraries preserved the texts, but very few scholars could read them.

[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/medieval-philosophy/](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/medieval-philosophy/).

Still, from the fifth to the ninth century those Westerns scholars who were still literate in Greek, continued to study and copy Aristotle and other important works.

Meanwhile in Byzantine Europe where Greek literacy remained high, the classics were never lost (despite the destructive influence of the Muslim conquests), and continued to be studied and preserved to a far greater extent.

**Preservation and translation of classical texts by Muslim scholars**

By the end of the tenth century Muslim scholars had access to virtually the entire Aristotelian corpus, in addition to important texts by Plato, Archimedes, Euclid, Hippocrates, Galen, and others. However, they did not preserve them by translating them. In fact Muslim scholars could not read Greek or Latin, and instead paid Christian and Jewish scholars to read and translate the texts into Arabic for them. It was these scholars, not the Muslims, who preserved the classical texts of the Islamic Golden Age. Muslim scholars nonetheless must be given full credit for their study of the classics, and the high value they placed on them. Their contribution was still significant.

Meanwhile, as noted previously, Greek classical texts were still preserved in Western Europe (to a small degree), and Byzantine Europe (to a much greater degree), so we would still have these texts even without the contributions of the Translation Movement of the Islamic Golden Age.

**European recovery of Aristotle through Arabic translations**

It is oft repeated that European scholars only started recovering the classical texts in the thirteenth century, when they finally had access to Arabic translations, which they translated to Latin. This is untrue.

Firstly, as has already been demonstrated in part two of this series, Christian scholars in the Byzantine East never lost access to the works of Aristotle and the rest of the Greek classical tradition in the first place, and even though Christian scholars in the West had their access to these texts severely limited, they nevertheless continued to copy and study the significant number of Greek texts they did possess. 

Secondly, Arabic translations of the Greek texts did not start to find their way to Europe until well after the West had already recovered almost all of the original classical tradition, directly from superior Greek texts, rather than translations into Arabic. Very few of the classics were recovered through Arabic, and the small handful which were, ended up being replaced by superior translations directly from the Greek shortly afterwards.

974,"How did slavery under indigenous, French, and English rulers differ from the slavery found in the Uniter States?","I was doing some reading about the history of Canadian slavery and came across an article about tribes such as the Yurok, Haida, and Tlingit on the West Coast participating in slave trading but it didn't go into much detail. There is also slavery under the French and English rulers, which while mentioned in schools, is not dealt with in as much detail as the American slave traders and the Underground railroad etc. Is there a reason as to why these things aren't as thoroughly discussed? Did they differ much from the slave trading in the United States?

Edit: I meant United States in the title. Too late to change it now.

Edit 2: to be clear, I went to school in Canada and graduated highschool in 2009. The curriculum may have changed since then.",history
975,"What causes the rise and decline of scientific, cultural and technological achievements?","Looking back throughout history, many great civilizations have invented many great things, but later on they stop inventing/innovating and eventually their innovations are passed on to another society. For example, the Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian civilizations made many ideas in mathematics and pre-science (such as Astronomy and Alchemy) and made great structures like Pyramids and Ziggurats, etc. But later on, they stopped making inventions/innovations and much of their knowledge was passed on to other civilizations, mainly the Persians and Greeks. Both the Persians and Greeks built upon the works of Near Eastern and Egyptians and made innovations in mathematics, ideas in philosophy and science and made amazing architecture. Then the Romans came along and took many aspects from the Greeks and build aqueducts, Colosseum, Forums, etc. Later on, it stopped after the northern invasions and while the Eastern half survived, then came the Muslims, and they took many knowledge from Greeks, Romans, as well as Indians and Chinese, innovated upon them. Then it all stopped after the Mongol Invasions, and even during the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire, they stopped inventing. Then we look at India and China. They made inventions of their own (Indians created zero and Chinese with their four great inventions plus the crossbow), but later stopped when the Mughals and Mongols respectively ruled over them. Even after (especially when the Chinese overthrew the Yuan), they made little progress in innovations. Western Europe was stagnating for quite a while, but after knowledge from the Muslims and Byzantine were passed on via the Italian Renaissance, then came great innovations over the past 500 years or so and kept on innovating while the traditional centers of civilization (the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia) stagnated in comparison to Western Europeans. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what is the cause of civilizations creating so many great inventions/innovations, then all of a sudden stopping?",history
976,"To what extent did the Persian Empire influence the development of other Ancient civilizations (i.e Greeks, Egyptians, Macedonians, etc.)","Learning about this topic because I’m quite interested and would love some clarification on answering it :)

After learning about the Greek wars with Persia and the battles between Macedonia and Persia, I came to wonder what led to Persia becoming this powerful empire in the first place and how they interacted with other cultures living at the same time.

986,How did Britain lost its empire and could it do anything to save it after WWII,"I know it's bankrupt and exhausted. But why gave up the empire so easily? Is it because 

1. It doesn't have the strength to defend the   colonies? But Asia and Africa are worse off after WWII, I assume? French fought wars trying to keep its colonies but it seems to me Britain just ... gave up?

2. It can defend its empire buy simply lost its will to do it?

3. It can if it wants to but did a cost benefit analysis and decided it's not worth it.

4. US was actively preventing Britain from doing so because now America is and wants to stay as No. 1 super power now.

In the US, however, there wasn't a major professional league for soccer until 1968 (the original NASL), and the MLS was commonly almost bankrupt until the mid-2000s. There wasn't a nation-wide Canadian League until the CPL, which has had just one season so far.

Now with this, I started questioning everything she ever told us.

Like I saw that one girl who's in her 20s, wanted to tell her mom off. But she said her mom drives her to college every day and let's her live there rent free. If she tells her mom off, all the mom has to do is refuse to drive her to college anymore or even just kick her out. The girl would lose everything. But all the people in the thread said she should tell her mom off...

I feel like I must be missing something. Why doesn't anyone mention that you can get kicked out? It ultimately kind of doesn't matter how right you are.

1137,Feeling Empty After Watching Anime? Your Lie In April *SPOILERS AHEAD*,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but here we go.

 \*SPOILERS AHEAD\*

I didn't know where to ask this, i tried asking it on r/anime but no one was willing to read the whole thing, so sorry, Im gonna dump my weird stress here.

I finished an anime yesterday: Your Lie in April. 

So.... I wanted to watch Your Lie in April for 4-5 months now, but I never finished it. Because my friend had spoiled that Kaori dies in the end, along with other parts of the plot. So for months, I had only watched 5 episodes, another reason was that I get really worried when people interrupt me when im watching anime because I'm always scared it will ""ruin the moment"".

Anyways, a few days ago, I was like ""screw it"" and watched the whole thing. Now I feel empty..

1)

First of all, I did cry a few times during the show, but not that much during the end, and that's one thing that worries me. People say things on the internet like ""I can't look at her without crying, she shouldnt have died"", ""this broke my heart"". Or things along the line of that. I can't help but feel like I'm missing it: the feeling. Because my friend told me she would die, I didn't feel much shock. because for months, I knew in my head ""kaori is dead"" the idea wasn't new to me. Also, my friend spoiled that kaori wanted to start violin because of kousei and etc. it really took the moment away from me. I still cried a bit, but when I watch the clip on yt, i dont cry at all, and peopel say ""i cant watch this without crying"". I'm a person who cries easily too. I just feel SO sad, because I am really missing out on something. Even though there was a lot of foreshadowing, in the end, there was a chance she woudl live because of the surgery, but i got spoiled.

2) 

Second, I listened to the soundtrack and ost multiple times before I actually watched the show. So now, when I listen to the ost, instead of getting nostalgic and feels of the show, I just remember the video the song was from. I just feel like I lost somethign again, something that could have stayed with me forever, was ruined. Now when I listen to the music, I wont be reminded of the anime.

3)

I feel kinda empty, I dont know why. This is because of the song problem and me not being that sad of the ending. But also, I just feel this weird emptiness, this only happens with ""sad"" anime. I just feel like I missed out, I had high expectations. 

(also, this isn't THAt big of a a deal, but during an emotional moment, my computer got a series of notifications, destroying the moment completely, I feel so sad)

If you check sites such as realtor and trulia, the average payment on a home is comparable to those of market rate rents (assuming you have enough to give a downpayment). It seems like the biggest barrier to owning a home is the lack of money to put towards the downpayment &amp; closing costs that are associated with the inital purchase. 

I know that there are several programs out there available to firsttime homebuyers that provide grants/loans that do not have to be repaid to cover a portion of the downpayment. There are even programs that reduce the downpayment to a mere 5%. But if you give a smaller downpayment you get hammered with mortgage insurance with end up driving your monthly payment much higher.

TL/DR: If the government is already providing grants and loans that forgiven that cover part of the downpayment, why not just make it cover the entire amount?",NoStupidQuestions

1152,Is the Michael Scott Paper Company a viable business strategy?,"Just finished the Michael Scott Paper company arc on the office, and I noticed it worked out pretty nicely for all 3 employees. They were offered a 60,000 dollar buyout, although they didn't take it, and I'm wondering if such a business strategy is viable in real world economics. 

In the final episode of the arc, they have a meeting with an accountant guy who critiques Ryan's fixed cost pricing model and tells them they are going to go broke because they didn't use a variable cost pricing model when coming up with their prices they sell paper at. However, I'm wondering if their pricing model was actually their greatest asset. Essentially, they operated at a slight loss for a whole 2 weeks, completely demolished a medium sized company's customer base by charging absurdly low prices, and then sold those customers back to the company they took them from. Would this work in the real world? Like if i opened a business and charged very little for my products and took all the business away from a smallish sized company then offered them to buy me out? I feel like you could make bank doing this over and over again. Of course the conditions would have to be right, and you would have to pick a sufficiently small market that you could control , even for a short time.

1233,Why are Fat people not allowed to be Happy until they're in shape?,"Why is this a globally accepted mindset that all fat people have to be shamed until they cut the weight?    

It starts at a young age from bullying, and even more widespread online. Even in such an open community such as Reddit, fat hate is very accepted here, and I don't get it.   

Why are people obsessed with forcing other people to living a long life?   

  

I guess the real question is, what's wrong with living fast and dying young?  

Why can't I by choice choose to eat every single tasty sweet I enjoy until I get diabetes and die early?   

I do that already, but I'm not very fond of food and I have a high metabolism so I don't gain weight, but not everyone can win the genetics lottery. What is the benefit of a long ass life when for many people it doesn't get better from when they are young. If you enjoy food, why is eating till you die a bad thing?    

I love extreme sports, if I were to die while jumping off a huge ski ramp, that would be fkn great. Literally reached for the sky before passing away quick and easily. I lived my best life already, there's no way I'm topping my youth, and not everybody wants to have kids when they're older.... so why does everyone **have** to be healthy?   

  

You're working, paying your taxes, adding to the economy, supporting consumerism and small businesses when you eat a lot of food.  What's wrong with fat pride?  

Why can't you enjoy that cake and enjoy your life. Why must you beat yourself up for not looking like an image from a magazine?   

The fat pride movement has gotten its ass kicked in. Especially for men, that's over. Women are still trying to push it, but it's losing. I seriously don't get why everyone is so obsessed with forcing people to live long lives in a shitty world. Let's be honest, a large percentage of life can be really shitty, and some people don't even get a choice. So why not enjoy the little things instead?   

  

Working hard and eating shitty food to live a long life and still being shit on by the world seems less appealing than eating great food, working at a comfortable rate, then dying from diabetes after your kids are all adults. Why even fight it, embrace that shit. I don't get why death is the enemy when it has to happen to everyone.   

Dying at a happy time seems far better than dying during a shitty time in your life. Dying before a shitty time seems like the lottery. We don't know what happens after death, what if you get to live another life?

Even though red bull is the one classed as an energy drink why do some of the American cans of pop says 34mg? I just don't understand why it would say more like for example on the American coca cola or Dr Pepper. I think a Dr pepper can I got the other day said 45mg on the can.

I hope my question makes sense, I'm not in America so I'm very unsure why it appears the caffeine content is higher? Here the caffeine content of a can of coca cola is not stated other than ""contains caffeine"".

 This happened around 10 years ago when I was 5 but I have been thinking of it a lot lately. I can still remember it crystal clear. 

 It was a Saturday evening and my then 26 year old mom had promised to watch a movie with me and make popcorn. She had put the movie on and told me that she would come back soon.
 
I was a nice kid and waited but I wanted to watch the movie and eat popcorn with mom so after around 5 minutes I decided to open the door to my parents’ bedroom and yeah saw my dad on top of my mom. I didn’t know what was going on so I just went to my mom and told her to come while trying to pull her out. Neither of them had clothes on but my dad told me to get the fuck out. 

 I heard my mom saying something to him, probably about how rude he was. Well my mom ended up coming out soon after and we watched the movie. I asked her what happened and she told me that they were play wrestling but I of course understood what was happening at around 13 or so.",NoStupidQuestions

1315,Does anyone else fall into rabbit holes like this? (Honestly feeling a little detached right now),"To elaborate a little, we all know that the presence of certain chemicals as well as the lack of certain chemicals can make us feel certain ways.

Obviously if I'm missing feel good chemicals I will feel sad. But if I sit down and focus really hard on my thoughts I can quite easily pull those thoughts to the side and resolve them, making me happy in the end.

Now I know I didn't just create the chemicals I needed just by thinking about things in a non-emotional manner. How does this process happen in the brain? What separates the hard-wired chemical code from my sense of self? Well fuck on that note I guess our sense of self could just be a chemical reaction that we dont really understand yet.

I guess I just dont really understand what makes a human a human. Like how do people fall into certain ways of thinking. Or is that me generalizing people. Does everybody constantly think about this stuff or do you guys just kinda live?

I really really dont want to sound cringey and shit. I just feel straight up psychotic. Like why cant I just chill and not worry about why I exist?  Is this why people flock to religion so much? 

I get that I desperately want an answer but I wont just settle for anything. And maybe I'm grasping at air here but damn there has to be something right?  

Something that let's me know that just because I'm stuck on this hell hole for the next ~50 years, give or take. Does it mean anything?  

Why do I want a promotion? Why do I feel like I need a house and to get my car fixed. Why do I feel like I need all these things.  All I really need is food, water, and some company. Luckily I have a wife and shes amazing and I love her to the moon and back.

But why do we have to suffer here for decades together and not know if we will see each other after this? 

That makes me sad. What if we both die and never think of each other again. Really makes the whole point of being together now seem stupid I guess.


Not stupid like it's not worth it. Stupid like silly. It's silly that I hold so much importance to my relationship but in the long run if she dies first I'll only have myself for the rest of my life anyway. But I only really have myself now I guess. I cant prove 100% that anybody else's consciousness is the same as mine. Shit you all might be fake. I doubt it but it's fun to entertain the thought. 

I feel like she loves me and that's great but how do I know that the thoughts going on inside her head are saying something opposite to what she shows me? 

Now I'm not paranoid by any means. I dont believe in these things per say. I dont believe that my wife hates me or isnt a real human. But I absolutely can not prove otherwise. It's quite the conundrum. 

Brains are terrifying. The things humans are capable of. The emotions we can feel and not feel are crazy. Sometimes absolutely baffling. 

We can feel so strongly about things that we straight up refuse to see details and answers in things because they dont/wont match our current world-veiw.  We really are ego-centered animals. Like maybe thats what we are, it just a complex evolutionary trait that we built on over centuries because it kept us alive? Our ability to feel empathy and compassion and to communicate was probably what kept groups of us alive long enough to build even more social skills. So on that note, society is in a way part of nature?

Like, is the PS4 better because it has Bloodborne? Thing is, below the surface, this is a game that COULD HAVE been on any other platform, it's just that it was made sure that it was on the PS4 only, in an attempt to get people to purchase PS4s (along with other games).

The Switch is a different story, because while it's inferior in raw power, it makes up for in the fact that you can literally use that same system to play the same games in handheld mode as well. There's an option here between catering to those that want more power for their TV, and those that want to switch between their TV and handheld modes.

The PS4 and Xbox One, however, are almost entirely the same, and the only real way to separate them, is their exclusives... but is that even fair?",NoStupidQuestions

But if because of microscopic differences in weight we were to find that in real life, tails is actually slightly more likely than heads; or say, rolling a 6 is slightly more likely than another number, how would we prove such a thing? Presumably flipping a fair coin some arbitrarily large number of times--let's say 10 bajillion--would almost never result in an precisely even split of 5 bajillion heads and 5 bajillion tails, right? There'd most likely be some slight discrepancy in one direction or the other, even if this truly was a magically perfect coin that has an exact 50:50 likelihood on every flip of landing on heads or tails.

So if we were to try to prove our coin isn't actually perfect (which I assume must be true, right?

I'm a freshman in Highschool and there's this girl that I have been interested in for a while now. I would say like two years that I've been interested in her.  
I know what you might say but it's not like I'm watching from the shadows or anything. We've always been very good friends. There were even point that I thought we were going to get into a relationship but she would say that not right now or ""people forcing us together."" But she sometimes just crosses my mind. Even when I would go off and find new girls that I had feelings for, she would sometimes cross my mind and then those feelings would ignite and then I can't stop thinking about her.  
I believe she has a boyfriend now but he's just not right for her in my opinion. He doesn't let her talk to other guys and she cheated on her at a new year's party and she's still with him. I even showed her proof of it happening but nothing. I'm just very lost right now, there are some days I just want to pour all my feelings out for her and tell how she makes me feel but I don't wanna ruin a relationship and have her hate me for it.

1610,"My ""Friend"" or His Friiieeennndddd?","Here's an odd one for you, A friend of mine loves to come over and spend nights at my apartment, that I share with my brother however, she never ends up sleeping next to me in bed but somehow ends up sleeping next to my brother. This annoys me because it makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home and is now one of the reasons why I try to avoid her. 

We grew up with very strict rules and you know, common sense that girls always sleep with girls and boys with boys, we're in University, my brother is good looking. Great. I just don't understand why I should explain this to her, she grew up in a christian home, same as mine. We have similar values/morals. Should this not be common sense? 

Oh, but there's a plot twist. My brother feels I am being unnecessary, we no longer live with our parents so we get to experiment and make up our own rules. I have spoken to him about basic things such as

1. Letting me know if any friends/family are coming to visit. 
2. His girlfriend may not sleepover but she may come to visit. 

These rules apply to me as well, I always ask him before I confirm plans with my friends and as if it's okay for them to come over, I have never let any of his friends sleep next to me in my bed and my future boyfriend will only visit and not sleepover. We've had these conversations multiple times, he doesn't understand why I'm such a stick in the mud. I've spoken to my mother about us living separately, it is quite expensive to do that, so I understand that it's not the most desirable option, which means we have to respect each other's boundaries and figure out how to somehow live in harmony, it hasn't happened yet. So now that you're all caught up, here are my questions. 

1. Am I being unreasonable with my rules 
2. From the male perspective, why is it so hard to understand that I feel uncomfortable with him having female company in his bedroom, (yes he does lock his bedroom door in the evenings). 
3. Can I have some tips on how to explain this to my brother, maybe I'm not explaining why I put these rules into place properly and his just dismissing them because he doesn't understand why it's so important to me, to be honest, the alternative is just that he doesn't respect my point of view and just doesn't care that I feel uncomfortable 95% of the time in my own home. I have no idea, send help.

I value my alone time, and would 1000% not have anyone over, if I lived alone because I'm so damn comfortable by myself, he spent a year alone by himself and he does not feel the same way. I've been alone for most of my life so it makes no difference to me, I believe he craves human companionship that isn't mine...

There are people out there that say "" just send the US military and we will get the job done and we will wipe them out "", but the problem is that it's not like the cartels members have a jersey or icon on thier forhead that says ""I'm a cartel member"" , the cartel has compromised nearly everything down there and everyone from the kid in middle school, to the car salesman , even the highest members in government are or are working with the cartels so it's far from being black and white.

1657,Why are black people good at sports?,"Blacks (i.e. people with genetic ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa) are over-represented within athletes who are successful.

One theory, which is probably somewhat true, is that it is cultural. Blacks are more likely to value sports success, and disadvantaged blacks are more likely to see sports as a way to rise from poverty.

Another theory is that blacks really aren't over-represented because they have higher participation rates in certain sports. For example, black people are more likely to play basketball casually, which results in a larger pool of elite black basketball players.

Yet, there are black athletes who have succeeded at the highest levels in where black participation isn't stereo-typically evident. Simon Biles achieved an Olympic gold medal for all-around gymnastics and Simone Manuel achieved a Olympic gold medal for 100-meter freestyle swimming.

1686,"I went back into nicotine, should I care about breaking my streak?","I used to be a smoker but completely quit nicotine for over 5-7 years (not sure exactly how long). No one ever asked me about it, but I've mentioned that I used to smoke maybe a handful of times to feel proud when the word cigarette came up.

But a month ago I started having a desire to start vaping. I think I just sucked in by the younger people around me vaping all the time. I romanticized it and told myself I wasn't going to care about how long I've been nicotine free but just free myself from that pressure and enjoy life and not regret it. I just wanted to be the kind of person who could have a cigar or take a cigarette/vape puff with someone without freaking out about  it or say no.

I went full in for a month and didn't allow myself to regret my decision. But one time I went to a party and some guy looked at my vape with disinterest and I realize how strong he looked without nicotine and that I was no longer that free grounded person.

So a month of vaping and now I haven't vaped at all in 1.5 days which I'm happy about but I'm also sad I didn't go a full lifetime nicotine free. One thing is I technically still didn't smoke a cigarette but did vape nicotine. But in my mind I would have been more proud if I had been able to say I quit nicotine that one time many years ago and never went back to it.

I'm not even 2 full days off nicotine and I can easily fall back into it but I'm trying to hold on by telling myself I want to go back because it's still fresh.",NoStupidQuestions

I've been having issues seeing things from a few feet away, it takes like 2-3 seconds for my eyes to focus in, and all the lights on cars and really any light has a super wide ring for about 2 years now, but I have a weird thing about my eyes being messed with and never bothered to go to an eye doctor. I finally did, and I'm genuinely surprised by what I was told.

The doctor said I am legally blind and have 20/200 vision. Something about a stigma in my eye? I think she said most pupils are shaped like a basketball and mine is shaped like a football. She said I should not have been driving and my eyesight is very bad. I think the actual description was near-sighted with a stigma in both eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm not understanding the different range of blindness or if she was wrong. My eyesight isn't constantly blurry, and I can see shapes and make out what most things are. It's just hard to focus in on print more than an arm's length out. I was thinking I'd need reading glass, not full-on all the time glasses. I've never used any correctional lenses, and my last vision test (the school tests in middle school) gave me 20/20 vision.
