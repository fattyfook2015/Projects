#Conclusions and Recommendations:
From our hypothesis testing, we have seen that there is a performance difference between the SAT and ACT. As ACT seems to be the one that most states make compulsory, there will be more participants (sample size) for colleges to set their requirements to best suit the candidates they onboard. Also, with a larger set of data, the examination board who sets the papers will be able to identify the scope of assessment to modify the syllabus to better represent the candidates' academic capabilities. 

Looking at Texas' participation rate, 66% participation for SAT and 41% participation for ACT, the state does not seem to have imposed any compulsory test. However, starting from 2020 low income students will be able to attain free tuition from the University of Texas. This would mean that low income students can consider entering college without being held back by their financial status. With more people considering college, they would have to participate in either of the tests. By making the one of the examples state funded, low income students considering college will be even more inclined to take either the ACT or SAT to enter University of Texas.
